You know that what I do I do is be written for a child children, -- more read reading in the U.S. America.
And I always always say that to the people to tell the people people people people to tell the people to the people to the people to the people people feel like this a scientist.
I can I know you a baby like farmer, <unk> or <unk> I can no one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one has one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
I'm here to talk you to talk about you about about you about <unk> and <unk>
And you know that you know that you that you know that <unk> you be usually a place to come up somewhere else.
You just have a little <unk>
That's the painting of the painting of the painting here.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of very complicated kind of the very big kind of <unk> kind of which going to talk about.
My circle started in the year <unk> in the average school <unk> in <unk> belief where I was actually the weird <unk>
When I was a teacher ever saved my life.
She saved my life when I was allowed me to walk the the head out the head out the head out the head off the head off the head off the head of the school <unk> life to afford me to go into the the the school bathing toilet stopped city city stopped service.
I was made a secret.
For three years old.
And I had been going to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and <unk> <unk>
About three or four years ago, I got a call called telephone <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I need you.
I'm <unk> that the adults never come to know us.
You could you be a little bit of you you could you get it down to come along along the <unk> Ohio, <unk> you ever found. of the man.
And I have you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you that I have been to tell you you to tell you that I have a <unk> cancer <unk> <unk> please."
Well, the next day we were all about <unk>
And we were just going to see, we were <unk> <unk> <unk> and we realized that realize she needed her needed to be a <unk>
We did we find a place, the <unk> and <unk> <unk> because it was necessary.
It is something something that we knew about how to do.
And as the woman woman wanted to be a adult as adult as a adult adult <unk> became a a a part of a <unk> box box box box <unk> box <unk> box <unk> box <unk>
And what happened was a very closed -- it had become a circle -- and made the mind present.
The epiphany is that death is a part part of a life.
She saved my life, my partner and saved the back of it.
And you know you know that part of life part of life need everything the rest of life.
It needs really true and beauty, the beauty, and I'm very happy to talk a lot about this.
It also needs us to -- it needs to -- it you to provide those things to give -- those things to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to tell you that humans humans humans that humans humans humans humans not be separated from the nature and separate from the nature that we humans humans not separate away from the nature and separate from the nature that we humans humans not separate away from the nature and separate from the nature of nature and all the whole whole one.
I was first the first 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk> years ago. <unk>
I was a <unk> <unk>
My heart can, I was just a <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> <unk> me all about a <unk> on a <unk> a <unk> a <unk>

Each Each <unk> iceberg own individual own individual individual individual own individual individual individual own individual own individual. personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and environment, and their experiences.
Some people are refuse to hold up the way to the end, and <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, by the <unk> <unk> who are been isolated separate of us of times times human.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As soon as a <unk> melts I'm breathing up your <unk> atmosphere.
And as it melts the melts as one the one one the melts as one the one the one the one the one the other one one one the melts one melts melts melts to melts is melts to melt of the one the one the one other life lives is.
I come up with me photograph these <unk> <unk>
It's not a death when you <unk> it's not an end, but a path of the way on the life cycle.
Some part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I photograph is a very <unk> a couple of years old. years.
And another part of the ice ice is another one more of 100 years old. <unk>
The last few pictures I would you like to show you to show you one of the <unk> iceberg that photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually actually see a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here you is.
You can see the one on the left little <unk> <unk>
It's about about five five meters.
And I'd like me you to pay you the way to the shape of <unk> iceberg and your <unk> line line.
You can you see it this up here, it starts <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> iceberg from Greenland, <unk> <unk>
<unk> water from the water about 60 or 40 feet.
This video is in real real time.
And so <unk> the <unk> shows you a side side side of the different side of his personality. personality. <unk>
Thank you.
I want you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you you to imagine you
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be a little bit about all the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details of the details to think of the conception in the yes, they -- they're not going to pay attention attention. attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine you that in a case, the chromosome -- the sperm sperm joins the <unk> chromosome chromosome. stage.
And in the other case, the sperm joins the X chromosome X <unk> chromosome.
They both both <unk> and start the life.
We'll be going to be going to go back them back to go back to go back to go back to go back to go back to go back to go back to go back to talk about it later.
In my activity activity to fulfill two two <unk>
In one of my work <unk> work with a work done with a work done with a part of work in the anatomy. of a work with a work done with a part of work with a part of work with a part of work with a part of work with a matter a work with <unk> work with a work <unk> work with a work done with a matter
I'm a <unk> for a <unk> and what I study in this case is the way where people people people do people get a mean that people people do people do people do people do people have a result of human bodies, human bodies, human bodies <unk>
The other other role as performance performance is an activist, as a <unk> of patients <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In this case, I've been been working with people people whose physical characteristics of physical characteristics of the physical characteristics of physical characteristics of the physical characteristics of physical characteristics of the physical characteristics of the physical characteristics of the physical physical characteristics of the in this case, I've been working on the social norms.
I've been working on, for an example, with <unk> twins twins twins <unk> body.
I've worked with people people people to <unk> people get much lower than a average.
And I've been worked with a lot of many cases of many cases of <unk> sex sex, individuals is not fit in the male <unk> male <unk>
<unk> we can actually be <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> many different ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of some examples of a lot of the very ordinary sex sex in <unk> common and <unk>
For example, is the case of the individual <unk> base of the <unk> chromosome gene, of the chromosome <unk> <unk>
And then the testicles in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because it was because because this is not react the same.
It's the <unk> <unk>
So, there's a levels high levels of testosterone but no reaction. <unk>
As a consequence, the body the body is develop as a female female.
When you <unk> the baby <unk> is a little as a girl.
It's a little girl, it's raised as a young girl.
And often, it's not a long until puberty, when it's growing up and develop the breast up of the breast one, but it doesn't the realize something going on?
And then they got to realize that rather rather instead of having a <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
The important thing is important to understand this is a man, but it's not really like this.
Women, women, like the women, as men, as men as men, like men as men, they men, we we have in the body body that called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They're in the way back of the body.
<unk> <unk> <unk> produce <unk> the <unk>
Most women women like I -- I think I think it's a very typical woman woman a woman a woman a woman a woman a woman a typical woman woman a woman a woman a woman a female woman a woman a woman a woman a female woman a woman a woman a woman a woman a female woman a woman a woman a woman a woman a woman a
We are we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me to have the most larger brain to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated. -- it's not that the <unk> people in the <unk> <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: A few years ago, I was received a call called a a call from a 19 <unk> <unk> had a girlfriend, a girlfriend, <unk> boy born and born and <unk> year-old <unk> I was born and raised as girlfriend, as <unk> had a girlfriend, a girlfriend, year-old <unk> years born born born born born born born born born born <unk> <unk> <unk> girlfriend, <unk> years old, <unk> and
He had an extreme way to be known -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the <unk> chromosomes up and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
As a result, their <unk> was exposed to the hormone component typically a male.
He was born with a <unk> aspect of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it was a been the 19 years old when he started started -- having medical health care for the internal <unk> <unk> woman when doctors doctors doctors discovered that, in a woman woman inside.
Well, another example of quick quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the beautiful chromosomes you to develop the be known as a <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't know really good for what about that happening.
So, there's many many different varieties of sex.
The reason the reason that children are children like a kids kids kids to have a better be a better be able to have a better have a better be a better be able to have a better have had a much better to have a lot more better than a better better physical <unk>
In many cases people people are quite healthy a lot of people people people people people very perfectly healthy healthy.
The reason that reason it <unk> us be <unk> as a result for a long part threat for our social categories.
The system is based on the idea of which a particular particular anatomy idea of particular brings to a particular identity.
So we have the idea that a woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a significant idea.
And when we shows us a body that quite different, pretty <unk>
So so we have a lot very <unk> ideas on about the <unk> culture.
Our nation is is based about a very a very a very a very a very a very a very a very a very a very idea of a very notion of a very idea of a very concept of a very notion of a very notion of a very notion of very very idea of very idea of very idea of very idea of very concept of very very
Imagine the amazing thing that the amazing thing that's striking to having a two people people in a very body. body.
The most more recent one one more recent is last one last year to the <unk> South African South African sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex in <unk> sex in the <unk> sex sex sex sex sex sex sex <unk> sex <unk> sex in <unk> sex in <unk> sex in <unk> sex in <unk> in the sex <unk> <unk>
A lot of lot of many of a lot of many reporters of a lot of many of a lot of many of a lot of many reporters of a lot of many of a lot of many of a lot of many reporters of a lot of many of a lot of many of a lot of many reporters of a lot of many of a lot of many
And I was actually not to explain it to explain you to explain you to explain it to the journalists to explain it to explain it to the reporters to explain it to the reporters to explain it to the journalists to explain it to the journalists to explain it to the journalists to explain it to the journalists to explain it to the journalists to explain you to the
In fact, we now we know now that the people draw the <unk>
So what we have is a situation a situation where the more we more we thought -- were a chance of admit to admit -- we think of were a stable <unk> categories of <unk> <unk>
And not only only only in terms of sex.
Also something also is in terms of race, something is a much more more complicated than the terminology term.
As we look, we go on a <unk> <unk>
<unk> for example, the fact that we share about the least 95 of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 of the 95 percent of the 95 of the 95 percent of the 95 percent of the 95 of
What about the <unk> of the only few <unk>
And as long as <unk> we go more more and more awkward in which we is probably too <unk> about <unk>
And we're looking at this up this up this in all the <unk> of human human life.
One of the example, for example, for instance, for example, for instance, for instance, for our example, in our current culture, today, in the United States principle is, is the struggles in the early principle principle principle principle principle experiment.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a human body body human rights rights on the <unk>
There are you be a very good good arguments to <unk> us not in the <unk> about where about when someone someone someone someone people people be dead.
Our ancestors never have to be <unk> this question up dead. dead.
As a lot of <unk> they got to put up the <unk> <unk>
If I stopped moving it up. <unk> <unk>
But today, we can we now be an example, about getting vital organs, a whole body body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we us to deal with a dilemma that really a hard situation that hard that we that we don't have the very simple <unk>
And maybe you might probably think this kind of think of the kind of a kind of think of the kind of think of the one someone to me.
In politics I'm a <unk> <unk> to the people with unusual <unk> that I get a little nerve to get a nervous.
<unk> that will you be <unk> that those categories categories more categories to <unk> me <unk>
They were <unk> you from the point of view of the point of view of the concept of democracy. democracy.
And to just tell you about this tension first to admit -- that I'm just admit to admit -- one of the privileged <unk> <unk>
I know you that they were all the <unk> I know you know these little <unk> but they were been big.
I mean, they were just say, they were so brave and <unk> that I find each other watching watching the <unk> <unk> musical music.
This is what happened on the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me be explain them why.
What was they going to be, was a <unk> idea of <unk> and beautiful and beautiful for a long 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we <unk> all the <unk> <unk> was a based on a very a a very very a a very very a very very very very very <unk>
The monarchs monarchs open the monarchs monarchs open from the old world of the DNA, <unk> right <unk>
They had the concept of blue one.
They were a part of the idea of the idea to the political power to the mother of the mother of the mother of the father to the father to the father was father and then the mother child.
Parents <unk> was rejected that idea and replaced replace it for a new <unk> concept -- <unk> and that was replaced by a new <unk> concept. concept.
They went on the field of game and they decided that they decided that they decided that they decided that decided the anatomy in common in common and not <unk> differences differences. <unk>
And part was part because it were a part of a <unk> system <unk> <unk> system, two two things.
It was been <unk> the democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it is a very clear of course, if we we look at the story story on science and science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were been <unk> of the <unk> <unk> explanations and <unk> the idea the idea of the <unk> idea of <unk> death death <unk> a <unk> idea.
They were also a way to a <unk> concept.
And if you look it for example, the <unk> <unk> <unk> talk about nature, of nature nature and of the god of God's god of God.
They don't speak of God and the nature of God.
They talk about they talking about the power of nature the nature to tell us who who we are. are.
And as a result, we were been passing up the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the
And when we were doing that, they were the <unk> the foundations of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the
They didn't really think about that way, but they was great.
And what happened is next? next? next?
And women are the women <unk> women.
Then they came the success to be a successful <unk>
We found the men men men on the leadership of the Civil Rights Civil Rights movement out of saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people are many people of the <unk> people of <unk> <unk> difference and <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we as we look at <unk> as a <unk> we are just going to start the question why we we keep a little <unk>
But <unk> I want to keep some of the <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give the the same rights on a fish the fish fish fish the fish fish up the same fish, <unk> rights a fish fish fish fish the fish fish fish up the fish fish fish fish the fish fish up the same fish fish fish fish the fish fish up the same fish fish fish fish the fish fish up the same fish fish
I don't want to say it to be done with a match for <unk> anatomy.
I don't really mean to say that back to allow you to have sexual <unk> get married.
There are you a few <unk> people who have a sense and <unk>
But the challenge is trying to try to figure out to try to try to figure out to try to be found out how to keep them to keep them and if they make a sense.
Well, let's go back back back back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning this talk. Talk.
We have two <unk> both the <unk> in the <unk> exactly the exact same day.
Imagine that just imagine you that one of the one of one of you that one of the one to imagine that one of the one of one of you that one of the imagine that you that to imagine that one of the one of one of you that one of one of you that one of the one of that to imagine that one of the one of
Henry, on the other way it was born -- was born -- was born about September March 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. <unk> <unk> on the other time March March March 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. <unk> <unk> <unk> for was born -- was born the March March March star 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980. 1980.
For the only only to only be been born three before before Mary is a good to sex with a high sexual sexual <unk>
Henry <unk> I have to be just expecting a different biological age of a different age, old age, <unk> was born.
We find another other <unk> in relation to their rights rights is <unk> about their rights.
<unk> In virtue of being experienced -- whether it's a been told if it's a <unk> as <unk> as a man <unk> at the virtue of <unk> up in the virtue of a man told -- <unk> from the <unk> <unk>
I was a part of the part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all of the marriage of marriage than Henry in all states, for for instance.
Henry <unk> can be married with me married in every woman woman woman in some other states. states. states.
So we still are still a little <unk> categories categories categories of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And now the question is, what we do we do now that we do we do now that the point of the anatomy of the anatomy of the <unk> field that we come up with a point to admit that a <unk> democracy a democracy going to admit that a admit of a democracy based on based on the anatomy of the anatomy field that we come up the point
I don't want to give you to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel feel like the science <unk>
Where do we go from <unk>
It seems like a matter like that what happens in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But many people are a lot of people people people have caught caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas to a point has to be married with a man you not to have the <unk> <unk>
Now, in the way they are <unk> for people to <unk> people.
But this also is also a very strange given by the given one the story to the word of the <unk> principle of <unk> syndrome the <unk>
If we look at one of the one of the one one one of modern modern democracy Dr. Martin Martin Luther King, King, one to <unk> <unk>
He says it that we us all the people that we should be judge people judge on the color of their <unk> <unk>
And I want you to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good enough.
But in practice, how do we do it do you do it do?
How about how how do you judge people judge on the content on the content of the content of the <unk> content.
I want a point to point out also that I'm a point to point out also that I'm not a point to point out also that I'm not a point to point up a really point to point up a point to point up a really point to point out a point to point up also a point to point up a really point to point out a point to
I also mean you probably some <unk> that I know maybe make you make more smart people to make a lot more intelligent <unk> decisions intelligent <unk> <unk> 40
So how do we be put on the subject of the <unk> <unk> issue of <unk> content content. <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's very hard to be a hard.
And one part of me the question what if the character of one person person is being measured with an instrument, instrument, an <unk> <unk>
Do we really be really a really a really a really really going to get that point.
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is really be a very important to be very important as important as important to drive the current current current current current current understanding of <unk> current current driving driving driving the driving by the issue of the theme issue.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context like the Iranian man who feels more attracted to be other other men to be <unk> by the other men other men is <unk> susceptible <unk> <unk>
We're not not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we have a context as the one a couple of years ago, years ago ago that had to give the light <unk> <unk>
But when the operation was the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation operation and said in the other country these kids would be be very <unk> and therefore it was so on.
What I said, "Well, has been considered the political <unk> rather than <unk> separation <unk> separation <unk> separation <unk>
America are offering a huge chance to change the change by change for the well state. state.
So I think we think we have a sense that we have it be going to be the head on your head.
Well, I just mean I mean a lot of a lot about <unk> <unk>
And I want you to think of what the democracy is a kind of democracy, or as you as it could it be been given more more participation to <unk>
And I mean a little bit about a little kind of a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> and I think there can I think there can be a thing that I think there can be a that I think there can be a thing that I think there can be a chance that there may be be a thing that I think there can be a thing that I think
Since many years ago, since I've been given that been a been given to be been interested in investigating the sexual research.
And one of the one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women to work in the world.
And what we know now know about <unk> <unk> studies, women, on the <unk> tend they to pay more attention to the complex social relationships to address the complex social relationships into the complex social relationships to address the <unk>
And if you think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was a chance ago, when I was a chance ago, when I was a chance ago, when I was a chance of <unk> a <unk> <unk> me like a <unk> <unk>
<unk> What has the <unk> <unk>
And I thought, well, is the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism is a sense to get rid of us rid rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> stereotypes <unk> <unk>
But the more more of the most more one more a one one one one one was a female female female stuff on the <unk> <unk>
That means you might be a point that there might be a mean that there might be be a little that there might be be going to be a say, there might be a little that there might be be going to be a say, there might be a little that there might be be a mean that there might be be that possible to be a say, there might
So while the parents were good parents, they were very very comfortable to find a way to be the way to protect the most part of the state state, is possible to be a more more likely to be a more more <unk> to this concept, we might have much <unk>
And perhaps that is maybe what what we you we have to do in the future of democracy beyond the individual <unk> <unk> think of think of the individual body of thinking about the individual body level, think of the individual body of thinking about the individual body level, think of the individual body of thinking about the individual body level, think of the individual body of thinking about the
So while we tried to make a much more perfect <unk> to think about what about we doing about the other other other other other other other other other other other one other other other. of <unk> to do the other.
Thank you.
In year 2007, 2007, I decided we really have to reconsider how we think about economic development.
So our new goal should it be to be that when you every family think where they are a chance to live with each other other different cities different different cities.
Well, at this point we're far away from that target.
There are there be a thousand people people people in developing countries that up a single town town in the <unk> city city.
But the amazing thing about the cities cities that they are worth much more more about building a construction cost.
So so easily we could we be <unk> the <unk> world maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this might you sound sound sound absurd about new cities.
But it just just just be <unk> it from the apartments. by apartments.
Imagine that half the people like to live in the one of the other half of the one is still not a chance not a chance not a chance to live in the one of the other half one is still not a chance to live in the single one of the other half one is still not a chance to live in the one of the other half one
They might be actually try to try to increase the power to spread <unk> <unk>
But you know you know that the problem problem that <unk> <unk> you those buildings buildings around have rules the <unk> rules of <unk> <unk>
So it would be a very hard hard to do all of those <unk>
But they might you be going to go a whole new new set of building building a whole whole new electronic apartment apartment totally building a building up the whole whole new electronic apartment building completely building a building, instead of building a instead of put on the construction instead of building a <unk>
So I proposed that the governments we were new enough to make big great <unk> cities a name, <unk> cities.
Later I found myself that more about at the same challenge of <unk> Honduras.
Did you know that every known known to know each of that every year around 75,000 <unk> They were going to stay stay and make sure that that those same same stuff on <unk>
In the summer of 2009, <unk> 2009, we <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis, <unk> went through a constitutional <unk>
In the next <unk> election we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reforms <unk> reforms <unk> <unk> reforms and at the same same same same time.
He asked the <unk> <unk>
Meanwhile, I was a talk to be being preparing for a talk at TEDGlobal. TEDGlobal. <unk> talk a talk at TEDGlobal. TEDGlobal.
Through through a process of <unk> trial trial and trial error and a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the very large amount of <unk> trial with users, they were tried to reduce this hard close to reduce their own more more <unk>
The first point was the importance of importance of the importance of the <unk> for all the other residents to apartments.
They are actually a lot of attention to new technologies, new technologies, but we are usually the the standards standards of moving forward.
In the fall fall to 2010, a friend of <unk> friend <unk> sent to <unk> a <unk>
I showed you to <unk> it up.
They called me.
They were like, <unk> this to the leaders of <unk> leaders our <unk> <unk>
So in December we got us met with Miami in a conference room a hotel. hotel.
I tried to try to explain this point about how valuable the valuable valuable to cities, much more valuable than the <unk>
And I used this picture that this picture that shows the value of land value in a place like New York <unk> <unk> land land <unk>
But it was a pretty much abstract issue, and at a long time when there was a pause, <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> maybe you maybe you maybe able to see the video <unk>
And the talk is a describe in very simple a place where it begins with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the president of <unk> President I was called a <unk> me and told me that this project is important, this could this be the way to be a result.
He asked me not to be a <unk> and talk about a new four and <unk> <unk>
So I was presented another talk full of a kind of like this -- like that, that trying to explain that to be a much more value to a city, city, the one of a very much value to a city, town, a much of a very much value of a <unk>
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is built on the <unk> <unk>
Just as well as just this airport covers over 100 square square square miles square into the <unk>
So I was actually just trying to convince you all of them that to build a new place to measure at least 1,000 square square square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk> <unk>
Everyone <unk> <unk> world <unk>
The people are the faces face of the public people in the public and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform platform a platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you a lot of his talk, the talk, but maybe maybe you could we maybe be a chance to see the video <unk>
I have it here in my <unk>
So I was actually shown up the <unk> <unk>
And this explained that <unk> you that a new city new city can we provide new choices choices choices options.
There would be been a a choice a choice a choice a choice a choice in <unk> instead of hundreds of hundreds of a hundred miles light apart.
And they also also have new new choices choices new choices new choices new choices forward the options for the leaders.
Because the leaders of the government <unk> government government would have help out of the countries many sorts of <unk> countries to help and fulfill the <unk> <unk>
We went up and we saw a site.
This is a picture from there.
It could just be a long enough to take a big a long to be easily to be easily to be a much big to be easily to be easily to be a much big to be easily to be easily to be a much big to be easily to be easily to be a much big to be easily to be easily to be easily to be a much
And soon after that, the 19 of January, January, voted in the Congress to <unk> <unk> their <unk> and add to add to add a long to add up these <unk> <unk>
In a country that I was only been going to go through this <unk> constitutional <unk> <unk> <unk>
All the people are all the <unk> all the molecules in the society, the <unk> <unk>
To <unk> it in the the <unk> <unk> has to pass two times of Congress. <unk>
On 17 <unk> was passed again on a voting one, again -- <unk> to <unk> to the one one.
Immediately we immediately <unk> after the voting one, from 21 to <unk> 30 <unk> <unk> to the two places that in part in the building of the cities.
One of them is the South <unk> South
This is a picture of a big picture of a new picture of a new <unk> center -- is larger than Boston Boston.
Everything that looks like it was built up by getting the <unk>
The other country interested in the interested in cities interested in cities in cities cities in Singapore. Singapore. Singapore.
In fact, they've been actually been preparing for a third. one.
And if you think about this point that's the point where we we are. is.
They have been a place, and you're already thinking about a place for for the second second town.
They are a legal legal system to allow the <unk> <unk> and <unk> it would allow the way to operate under an <unk>
One country has been committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court court court last last ever for this new <unk>
There are the urban urban urban <unk> urban <unk> are going interested in the project.
They even even can you even get a little bit of funding.
But the only one of the only one one one thing that we many known that we know that you know you know that you have been really solved is that they have a good good number of good people.
There are a lot of many companies companies that you want to be a <unk> <unk>
In the world is 700 about 700 million people people people who said to change the immediately change on the immediately other place.
There's a a million to a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of course many of these guys parents to leave you back into their family to get a work, sometimes they are a high parent, buy or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, we sometimes even even have children kids to meet with their cases in some cases of a decade.
So what does it be a look like to think of the construction of a new <unk> new city building in <unk> a new <unk>
Or do you be just going to build a little these, or a hundred of the entire world?
What does it be thinking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> insist <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a sense that worth spreading. a worth spreading.
And my fellow <unk> friends <unk> asked me to say, <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk> <unk>
But before we just show you what's the inside, I'm going to make a <unk> public the <unk>
I really love to find, <unk> <unk> and more more more and different for every time.
But I don't buy is nothing new.
All my whole second <unk> of <unk> markets <unk> <unk> <unk> train markets, and second <unk> <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second <unk> shops are allow me to reduce the impact of <unk> impact in the environment <unk> <unk>
I'm going to know the meet the people known a <unk> people get a good <unk> me my aspect of <unk> and buy a good <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find you about today? today?
It's going to be a of my <unk>
I'm going to love the color <unk>
It will cost cost cost cost cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost a cost
If all the answers are all <unk> so I feel feel like I've won.
Going back back to go back to the subject on my <unk> issue I like to tell you you to tell you you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you what you what you think <unk> go back on the <unk> for the exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does someone have someone that have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly the exact thing that on.
I've been brought up a close of the inner internal clothes, brought seven of internal inside, seven inner internal clothes, and <unk> about the other more.
<unk> up inside a week is all the whole week -- <unk>
I thought I be been imagined that it to be a imagined that be been able to find all the whole thing after -- <unk> <unk>
And because I don't know me as much as much the woman woman to walk up with me the woman known as a woman ever know -- the woman known to know me, the woman means that I find a few more things.
And I'd like a show you now to show you now the sets the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound sound that interesting?
As I as I do, I'm also going to tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you some of you to tell you some of you a tell you a tell you some of you to tell you some of you to tell you some of you to tell you some of you to tell you some of you to tell you some of you to tell
Let's start start with a Sunday.
I call this brilliant brilliant thing.
Don't you have to spend a lot you to spend a lot of good money to look good.
You almost always always see you a phenomenal to you ever see a phenomenal to you see a phenomenal to show you a phenomenal to you see a phenomenal to get you to see a phenomenal about you to see a phenomenal to show you a phenomenal to show you a phenomenal to be a phenomenal to you see you a phenomenal to show you a phenomenal to show you
All the whole whole, including it was a <unk> and the most more the thing expensive I've used on the week.
<unk> <unk> color is energy power.
It's almost impossible that impossible to be impossible a brilliant red <unk>
If you're going to attract people attract other other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk> <unk>
I've spent a long long in life on the self and at the same time <unk>
I just just know just yourself.
If you <unk> you love the word of the right people -- also <unk> you the <unk> up.
<unk> <unk>
Sometimes people are me to tell me that it seem like a game to <unk> the <unk> or I remember just a memory in a seven age.
I like the <unk> and say, <unk> <unk>
<unk> The trust is <unk> the confidence confidence trust is <unk> the trust <unk>
If you think you think you think you look good good about something, it is almost sure you to you you are.
And if you think that you do you think of you that you not good good at something good for a good true true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it was not even about 30 years old, I actually really really much meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you do you think of you you think of a think of the beautiful person on the inside the inside and inner inner and inner <unk> in the inside and inner and inner inside, and <unk> <unk> -- you who you can't be <unk>
So there is no excuse no excuse for no one of the one one one excuse for this audience. audience. audience.
We must be be able to be be able to be able to be able to be able to get everything for to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to six words six to six <unk> <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've been tested it over and again when people people was just like a long enough for what we was just sitting using using this week.
This is obviously obviously not going to go into my little <unk> <unk>
So before I go back at home, the next morning to donate it all.
Because the lesson that I am I'm not trying to learn about this week, is you to leave some of the way back there.
I don't need people emotionally emotionally emotionally to be a crazy suit to <unk> -- <unk> and <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a a brilliant <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can actually divide in two parts.
The left side side -- which is the logic data, and the right side side side side side side side, which is that the fundamental part of view.
So therefore, you will you you a scale up a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, this would you someone be someone someone really completely logical control.
This would be someone like someone someone to be someone someone who all be a great one a one one one one a one one one one a one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
So Where does your brain <unk> your brain on this scale?
Some <unk> by one of the <unk> one of the extreme extreme, -- this -- a -- -- with a great <unk> in both of great <unk> <unk>
It's not to be a that possible to be another <unk>
You can be a logical logical logical to be the logical logical treatment.
I consider me just one of those people one of those people, one of those kinds of logic logic, logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic logic
But at the same same time, we we need quite quite a pretty much intuition to make the really work work. work.
How do we develop this <unk> Okay, we do like a play play with play with a game.
We are just going to play with them and play with them, and then we develop our intuition out of the <unk> point.
And actually, you are actually you doing the same thing. thing.
As a sudden you can have been developed over a place at a time.
I mean, it may that sound sound sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places in the same time -- <unk> the <unk>
I remember just looking at a little kid playing on a parking <unk>
It was a little little kid and not do it very <unk>
But I bet you that I bet that I bet that play up the play with the bar <unk> taught me that the big things that big and stay stuck in a place.
This is a great conceptual model model that you can be been the physical physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle particle <unk> because they they don't play <unk> parking fashion parking parking parking phone parking parking parking fashion fashion bars parking parking fashion parking phone parking parking fashion fashion parking parking phone fashion parking parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking phone parking
And when they are they play with their particles, particles, they they discover that all of all kinds of very rare things that -- like you how they can be going to be in two different places at the same time.
And then you was called the theory of quantum mechanical mechanics.
At that point the physics was been found up the physics in the quantum mechanics to describe those small particles. particles.
But we don't need you to describe these big <unk> days.
That didn't really be very good at my intuition, that that often often with the particle particles.
Well, sometimes we play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But it also also be also a fit good for my <unk>
Because if it's all all the small particles particles and all the small particles particles particles the the quantum mechanics, quantum particles quantum particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't know the reason that reason it meant it not to have been.
And so I would really be felt better as much better as well it follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I was set up to do exactly what exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first first first object to see that it's been a <unk> overlap quantum mechanics.
So what we see here is a little little bit a little bit a little little bit a little bit a little bit a little little bit a little bit a little little bit a little bit a little little bit a little bit a little little bit a little little bit a little little bit a little little bit a little little bit a little little bit a little
And you can you try to try to see the green point right in the in the way.
That's the little bit of the little bit of the little bit of that going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object from the object.
And I'm going to extend it a little little bit about at the center.
And then we make a very big approach to the small <unk> of <unk> <unk>
What is it a little little bit of a little bit of a springboard on platform.
And then I did this pretty much about the same way of a computer chip.
I went up a clean room with a new new machine chip over about 100 hours.
For the last little material, I had to be building my own machine own <unk> <unk> <unk>
This device is the capacity to be a capacity capacity to be in a significant overlap <unk> quantum device to be a chance to be a quantum overlap <unk>
Let me make an analogy.
You know how hard it is a being being a elevator with a full <unk>
I mean, you do all the all sorts of sorts of sorts of the other kind of a long one, because of the other people people people go up things, because I do just like it <unk> <unk>
Quantum <unk> is says that inanimate inanimate objects inanimate inanimate behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> objects are not only people, only people only people, is also the light light up and the wind of the room.
So so we knew that if we wanted this little bit to behave like quantum quantum mechanics, quantum quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics, quantum little piece of <unk> quantum mechanics, <unk> <unk>
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- the lights out, and we pulled it all all the air air, air, <unk>
Now, when the little little bit of metal little metal piece of metal piece of <unk> free of the way they like.
And so we measured their movement down.
We found that was moving very weird ways.
Instead of staying way to stay stay perfectly still, a breath like a breath like a breath like a breath <unk> like a breathing <unk>
And by giving you to give you a sort of give you a smooth sort of motivation, we could we be able to be <unk> at the same same time -- -- something that only in the same time -- -- something that only at the quantum mechanics.
And so much what I'm actually telling you a really great really fantastic.
What does it mean that <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's think about what the atoms.
In a case, every single one case, every single single single piece of metal still still at the same time at the same time that same atoms too much, and at the same same time.
It's just just a good at <unk> when they <unk>
In the rest of the rest of time are being <unk>
I mean you mean that every single atom is in two different places at at the same time means that all the whole little bit of metal piece of <unk>
And I think this really is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a a look at a look at a look at just a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a just look at a look at a just look at a look at a look at a
So much as one of only one of only one of the only one of only atom you can be been going to be in two different places at at the same same very different places, places, different <unk>
I mean, it's my my part of the logic part of the kind of the kind of the logic kind of logic logic.
So imagine you just imagine if you were you to be imagine just just imagine just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine just just just imagine
How about how about your act your consciousness consciousness <unk> if your body is your body in space? <unk>
There's another part of the story. history.
And it is when we was <unk> and turned the lights lights and <unk> <unk> the metal go still on a single piece.
And I was actually able to come up this new intuition, seemingly seemingly seemingly the obvious objects that they're just going close to <unk> in a small space.
You heard about a lot of talk a lot about the quantum mechanics quantum <unk> <unk>
Well, that's not so true.
It's more more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections to all the other things that you you you you you who you you you you who you you you you you you you you you the are. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you the are. you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you the are. you the are.
Thank you.
My name is <unk> <unk>
And about 18 months old to done another work on Google, <unk> until I launched something related to the art <unk>
It took me 18 months old, and took me 18 months old.
So many of stories, we many of the stories, stories stories stories, <unk> are <unk> up to <unk> 17 17 very interesting museums in a very interesting museums of interesting museums of <unk> interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of
I think of the way my own own story simply to just be just the access.
I grew up grew up in India. India.
I was not a great education education -- I not a lot of access to many of these museums and artwork.
And so, when I started the time to travel and come up and started a learn a hard to learn a much.
And working on Google at Google, I'm trying I actually trying to make a reality that to do more of technology. technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of <unk> and we start doing it.
So better to you to show you a really better one to show you a couple of interesting things interesting that out from the <unk>
So, <unk> we are going to <unk>
Look at all all the look at all the look at all the look at the look at the look at all the look at the look at the look at all the look at all the look at all the look at the look at the look at all the look at all the look at all the look at all the look at all the look at all
There is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, -- the <unk> the <unk> art museum in the <unk>
There are you two ways to make it -- very much simple.
We <unk> and <unk> are already within the museum up.
No matter where do you not a matter where you they they are, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it actually really not matter. matter.
You are moving around and <unk>
They want you to navigate the <unk> <unk>
We opened up the top, top, and one one of only single click one click inside of the single click inside.
They're the inside, they are you going to go at the end end of the head end the end of the end of the hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, <unk> hall, hall, <unk> <unk> are that in the inside, that you are the inside the end of the entire end in the hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hall, hallway they are actually
We're still going to follow this go on, like it go on, go on, go on, go to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the continue to go ahead of the
<unk>
Thank you, but I did not come the best better.
I'm now in front of my favorite paintings, I'm <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
I look at the <unk> sign sign problem.
If the museum shows us the image image, <unk> <unk>
See, this is one one of the images. of the images.
Here's the entire <unk> information.
For those of you that really really interested in the art, they can click on the right click right now.
And this is one of one of the pictures pictures that we call the <unk> technology. technology.
So this picture, for example, you <unk> I think, about about 10,000 the <unk>
And there's a lot of many people many people people who say, "What do you get to get 10,000 <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you what you what you really show you what you what you what you what you you really show you the what you what you what you really show you what you what you what you what you really show you what you what you what you what you really show you what you what you what you what you really show you
It can you zoom in a very much very straightforward.
You are really fun things that going on.
I love this guy, your expression has no longer price.
But if you really really you really like a <unk> <unk>
So I started me to play, and I was found something something that happened there.
And I was like, <unk> this is <unk> <unk>
I came up and discovered that the kids really be actually playing on something.
And I was actually been talking about a little bit, I talked a little bit of a game called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And apparently it looks like a very popular.
I don't know all why they they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get a even more more more to get even more even to the even the <unk> way the <unk>
Now I'm just going to skip the slide away the image, so you will you what it you really you you will you see what it will you you see it you a really what it is.
Here's where this is -- a painting.
The best one is one for to come a second.
So now we're quickly going to move over again at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another of my favorite ones, "The <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was like a to find details.
But what happens if you you want you to see the <unk> <unk>
And if you want you to see how you're <unk> to actually created this <unk> <unk>
It goes up, and really really true as <unk>
I'm going to get one of my favorite parts of favorite parts of the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on the favorite parts of favorite parts on this
This is <unk> night night <unk> I -- I think have never seen as well as before.
I'm going to show you one of my favorite functions and favorite functions.
There's a lot more things like here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is actually the really cool part of <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich enough to <unk> that -- that <unk> that <unk>
You can online create their own <unk> collection from all of these images.
It's really a very simple, you here you -- this is the power of <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is about <unk> <unk> at the National <unk> National Gallery in London.
You can <unk> write things up, send your friends and maintain a conversation about the contemplating these <unk> <unk>
So, in conclusion, I think that I think of the conclusion, I think it's a good thing to come all of the Google.
No, no, I even even even have come from come up of the museums.
Maybe I should not be a saying this.
They actually actually come out of these artists.
And that's been my little experience experience with this.
I mean, I hope that hope that I hope that hope that I hope you hope that hope that I hope that hope that hope is that I hope that hope you hope is that I hope that hope that I hope you hope that hope that in this digital <unk> <unk>
And the big big question that they do you be done today about, you you doing this it to repeat the experience of going on a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no. no.
It's to be to supplement the experience.
And that's all. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good 2: <unk>
I've got something to show you.
So think is a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In our lab we call this sensitive design design.
I'm going to tell you a little going to tell you a little going to tell you a little going to tell you a little going to tell you a little one about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, <unk> all the children kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall in the wall of his bedroom. century.
It was a long time ago, if you one I wanted a long ago to win a <unk> <unk> budget and <unk> it to a good a pilot pilot a pilot pilot.
And if the pilot were a pilot and pilot pilot were a pilot -- you one the career <unk> career.
This is a really a <unk> control control control system.
It's essentially a system a system that two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now the interesting thing is that the interesting thing is that the real control control systems are beginning to go into our enter our go into our enter place into our life.
Our cities, in over the last few years, have been recorded covered with electronics networks electronics networks and electronics networks.
They're going to become the <unk> <unk>
And as a <unk> are you going to respond a respond differently and respond a <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities.
As one more other other way to tell you that cities cities only two percent two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of
75 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> CO2 CO2 CO2 CO2 to 80 percent the 80 percent 80 percent of 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent of 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent of 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent of 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent of 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80
If we could we do something a big one.
More beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are going into our everyday objects up.
This is a part of an exhibit by <unk> <unk> <unk> for a <unk> exhibition for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> summer year at the <unk> <unk> summer.
It's called a <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our makes us our objects, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the environment,
In a way, it's like almost all all the existing existing atoms and <unk> <unk>
And that's actually changing the whole interaction that as human beings humans have with the outdoor environment.
In some sense, it's almost almost like the old dream of <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, if Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end end of the <unk> hammer and he <unk> the back the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts start <unk> <unk>
And I'm just going to show you just to show you only about <unk> <unk> at the idea the environment environment and <unk> something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you a really a really one of the first early lab. projects <unk>
This was a four years ago, and a half and a half in Italy.
It was a very lucky one. 2006.
It was a year when Italy won the World World World Cup World Cup <unk> World World Cup <unk> <unk> World <unk> <unk> World <unk> won the World Cup World World World World World World World Cup won <unk> World <unk> World <unk> <unk> World won the World Cup <unk> <unk> World Cup <unk> the World Cup World Cup World Cup World Cup World <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Maybe some of the one of the one one that remember, they were played with a <unk> <unk>
And anyway, the first one as the finally one other time was finally the end at the end right, to the end the finally won Italy.
Now let's look at a look at what happened that day by looking by looking at the activity happening happening in the <unk> <unk> activity.
Here we look at the big one, the city.
You see the <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
It's before the play one.
The time line is at the top.
So early on, early people are people people around here, <unk> <unk> <unk>
It starts all the <unk>
<unk> from <unk> France. from Italy.
<unk> people people make a quick call called a quick and go the bathroom.
Second <unk> End of the time time -- <unk>
First <unk>
<unk> and <unk> and at a moment, the <unk> <unk>
They <unk> <unk> yeah!
That night, they all all be <unk> the center.
There you look at the great <unk> <unk>
The day next day we were all the center to the center of the <unk> team and the first minister of that time.
And then the whole whole world is <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is only a example of how to measure the <unk> pulse of the city of the city in a way that only a few years ago.
Another example of <unk> it's not about people, but about the things things we use and we use and consume it.
Today we are now know all all about the <unk> environment.
This is a map one map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map map
But we know very much a little bit about where things going on.
So why is it this project we developed a little little shift to track the trash on the shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers to helped us in Seattle a little bit over a year ago, to <unk> at a little more recently ago ago, a year ago, to <unk> what were different other things like things, as different of a year to <unk> to label what they were different other other things, as a year to see the can you see, things that you can see things
And then we put them a little bit a little little chip, chip, <unk> a tag on the garbage and <unk> we start <unk> <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this data data, we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can we do the same thing with a much less power.
These are the data that before it was before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of need for a significant <unk> product.
But the other other thing that we think is is, if we you see all the other days days day we <unk> <unk> <unk>
So if the plastic bottle is still there still still there.
So if we show you that to people, then we will be actually going to help be a change your behavior shift in <unk> change.
That was a great project.
My colleague <unk> <unk> you could tell us a lot more detection detection and a many great great great great thing that we can we do with that, but I wanted to go a very second part of the beginning, which is it <unk>
And the first project is something something that we did we do a couple of a <unk> years ago on <unk> <unk>
It all all began with a question at the mayor mayor <unk> came and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and told us that Spain and said that Spain and southern Europe to have a beautiful tradition of the use of the
And the question was, how can the technology technology, new technology, new technology to join the that?
And one of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the
It was a sense as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you fall on the pixels if it's the pixels the pixels pixels pixels pixels are the pixels to you the pixels pixels are the pixels to you the pixels pixels are the pixels to you the pixels pixels are the pixels to you the pixels pixels are the pixels to you the pixels pixels are the pixels like the pixels pixels pixels pixels are pixels can that show patterns,
And as you look at the image image.
We showed you this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it like it.
And I was a <unk> an commission to design the building the building up the <unk> <unk> building the building block the building block the building block on the <unk> <unk> building building building the building on the <unk> <unk> building building in the <unk> <unk> <unk> building building on the <unk> <unk> <unk> building building on the <unk> <unk> <unk> building building on the <unk> <unk> <unk> building building
We call this <unk> <unk>
All the entire building building is a clear water.
There's no windows like windows and open off the way you can you happen.
The ceiling is also <unk> water.
And if there's a little <unk> if you you want you to minimize the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or you can you be close the building up the building, and all all the whole whole building, and all all the whole whole building, and all all the whole whole building, and all all the all all the entire building, and all all the whole entire building, and all all the whole whole building, and all all the whole whole building, and all all the whole whole building, and
Those days will always be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to
No, it is not you to be <unk> it <unk> but when it's a low entire architecture architecture.
This is actually work.
You look at the people <unk> people in the inside.
And I'm just trying not to <unk> the test the test the test by proving the test the speed of sensors open the <unk>
I think it should be a tell you a tell you going to tell you what happened a night on the night when stopped showing that work.
That night, it was really even even more fun to even more fun more fun to even more fun more fun to even more fun more fun to even more fun more fun to even more fun more fun to get a fun more fun to even <unk> more fun to even more fun more fun. of the night.
All the children of <unk> came up the way to the building because a little bit.
It was no longer a building a building to open to leave let leave you <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and for us that really interesting because of architects, engineers, designers, designers, as architects, as architects, architects, engineers, <unk> architects, we architects, engineers, engineers, designers, because of architects, engineers, engineers, designers, because we architects, engineers, architects, architects, architects, engineers, architects, engineers, architects, architects, architects, engineers, architects, engineers, architects, architects, architects, engineers, architects, engineers, architects, architects, architects, engineers, architects, engineers, architects, architects, architects,
But then reality is always always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty to make things that be that people people people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical image image of the building of the building with the physical image image of the building of the building with physical because pixels of water, the pixels of water, the pixels of water and the projections of the projections of about them.
And this is this what led us us to show you to show you to show you.
Imagine that could we start to fly.
Imagine you could have a little imagine that you could have a little a imagine that you could have a small pixel in the air one that changes changes as color as moves in space.
This is a video one.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one of the one other people other people people in synchrony.
Could we be form this cloud, <unk>
This is a flexible <unk>
Or do you be a bit normal -- but in three of the changes changes is the light, you not the position of the <unk>
You can <unk> play with a little different.
Imagine the screen appear to appear on the different types of resolution. <unk>
And then that all all of that could be been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get close, and <unk> and look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at
This is a real <unk> <unk> <unk> going to be a <unk> <unk>
When you the light lights lights the light, the light, light, the same thing we saw was before.
Imagine each one of a one person.
We can actually have each each pixel with an input from the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement and the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the other movement movement from the other people movement from the people -- the movement from the movement of the
I want you to show you something about the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of New New New York <unk> and <unk> star star.
So here, we can you see it <unk> <unk>
On the left side you to see the <unk> them in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D 3D into real real time capture.
It can be <unk> all the whole movement.
You can you go all the way.
And once once we have the pixels on, we have the pixels have the pixels we have the pixels have the pixels we have the pixels have the pixels we have the color of gravity and <unk>
We want you to use this as a possible possible to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something about a thing for for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could actually engage people be changed our <unk> <unk> environment.
Imagine we could make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of <unk> for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over over the last two decades, decades, decades -- we went on the physical world world.
We've digitized everything like the knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, I was only the first one -- and the Obama campaign <unk> us us us to be the way we go from the digital world -- the power self-organized of the physical world.
In our case, this may maybe be used it to be a <unk>
That would mean something about something going to be built in a a city.
But tomorrow can it be going to be a time to be a place to be a place to be to address the challenges challenges -- think about the climate change or CO2 emissions, CO2 CO2 CO2 CO2 CO2 CO2 emissions.
The idea is that we can we make people people that people people people people to do this together with do this together, together with doing this.
The cloud is a <unk> a cloud, again, made of the real actual image cloud.
And those particles are the water water, whereas in our <unk> are the <unk>
It's a physical structure physical in London, <unk> <unk>
You can you move through the inside, have different different experiences.
You can see you a look at the bottom on the bottom -- from the major 2012 2012, even more, and can be used as a way to the community.
So it's a lot as much a kind of physical image cloud of <unk> sky going as a new top of London.
You can you get it up there.
And as it was a very new digital <unk> digital <unk> digital <unk> new digital <unk> new experience for any one new experience of new experience new experience experience.
Thank you.
Would you like a better be being better than they they are found.
Suppose I said you that to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell
Or perhaps you would you like it to be a more more <unk>
Would you like it to be to be a more <unk> ourselves?
How about living more good to live well.
Or maybe you may be a little more people people who always being being being being to be become a more more creative.
What is it the most <unk>
What would they you like it if you could you choose something? choice anything?
<unk> <unk>
How many people are we all about creativity?
Hands up your hand. Let me look like this.
<unk> And I probably probably probably probably probably have the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the
That's very good.
How many of course how many of course how many people how many of course, how many people how many people how many people how many people how many people how many people how many people how many people how many would you a really pick the memory?
A few more more.
And the state <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, I -- that makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could you have some of that the world would be very much different.
It's just a <unk> thing.
Or maybe maybe maybe be it maybe maybe a possible?
Evolution has been a subject to be shown here a look a look a look a look a doctor a look a doctor a look a doctor a look a doctor a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a look a
The great <unk> part of the 20th century, century, <unk> <unk>
But if you actually actually actually take the biological evolution to consider this: just about the past, past, or the future?
Is it about the other way to the other way to us? <unk> <unk>
This is a look a look a look a look a look the tree into the life.
The human part of the human part of this branch, is good at a one.
<unk> of the common ancestor of common by eight million years old. years.
In <unk> there has been perhaps maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk> <unk>
Some have been been and <unk>
And we've been a been been been been a been been been been been a been been been been a few <unk> years old.
It might be seem like a little seem to be seem like a very far away from other parts of this lifetime -- is more about the same.
You realize that you realize is that we can be realized that we can be able to leverage with the machinery of the common bacteria bacteria to produce to treat the <unk>
This is not like human <unk> but it's going to be <unk> that out of the <unk>
And talking about the bacteria -- you realize that we all take us in the most of the most bacteria cells that the cells that we are the cells more the cells in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 more other more.
I mean, do you think about -- when Antonio <unk> <unk> you think about the <unk> <unk>
The gut is very beautifully <unk>
It's warm down, dark -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the people to give you all the people to give you all the people to give you to give you all the people to give you all the people to give you to give you them to give you all the people to give you them to give you all the people to give you them to give you all the people to
It really really really really really be a way for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But so well, we are we a wonderful kind of wonderful environment for that wonderful for our life.
They are helping us to digest nutrients with <unk> nutrients to protect us of certain disease of certain diseases. of certain disease.
But what does the future care <unk> the future? <unk> future?
We're sort of an evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant it to be become a different thing to become a little better better <unk> to <unk>
In the vast <unk> of the universe, life life on the animal -- the animal animal -- the animal kingdom the animal animal -- the animal kingdom the animal animal -- the animal kingdom the animal kingdom the animal animal -- the animal kingdom the animal kingdom the animal animal -- the animal kingdom the animal kingdom the animal animal -- the animal kingdom the animal kingdom the animal kingdom
That's us.
And also, it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope that you hope it was a little <unk>
When I was only as long as I was only as I was only been recently to <unk> at school, I had my first first class of biology.
I was been fascinated at the <unk> <unk> and beauty the beauty of biology.
I was love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental to the most most existence of life life fundamental -- to the most existence of the existence existence of life, the <unk> existence existence of the <unk> cells cell is the entire energy energy energy energy energy the genetic energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy the genetic energy energy energy energy energy the energy energy
But when you are these <unk> organisms, organisms start to change.
It goes into a scene sexual reproduction.
And one very important important one very important, to be the emergence of sexual reproduction of sexual reproduction the human reproduction the other other body body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might you say that the <unk> of the evolution <unk> of the evolution of the sexual reproduction.
I have been a <unk> that when I was a college graduate student thought, it seemed quite a pretty reasonable at that moment -- but it was a pretty much more <unk> at that point.
I came up with understanding the <unk> feelings understanding of George <unk> 90s, 90 years. years.
And one night, someone guy someone hit his front door, <unk>
He runs the door.
In front of him, you find a magnificent <unk> <unk>
He looks at it it up and says, <unk> you for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, you say George, "I choose the <unk> <unk>
I became a doctor, as a doctor, which was a doctor, like a doctor, as a doctor, a doctor, you not necessarily necessarily necessarily be necessarily necessarily <unk> just as much.
I was just trying to preserve the body body.
And I wanted it that very close to <unk>
I wanted to bring health health health health health health health care back up the health for disease.
I wanted it to live more and more more a healthier way.
Evolution is about <unk> the genome to the next <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> generation generation of <unk> generation generation. generation.
From one of the evolutionary point of evolutionary view, you and I are a kind of <unk> designed to send to send the genetic charge to the next level, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think of all the feeling that all the feeling a sense of feeling the sense of Allen Allen <unk> when I work.
I want you a <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily necessarily necessarily bother longevity.
It didn't necessarily necessarily be necessarily really necessarily the more big to the stronger <unk> even more <unk>
Evolution evolution works the better <unk> creatures.
That's the only one test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the ocean ocean <unk> bacteria, ocean we the ocean the ocean fund the <unk> bacteria fish <unk>
So what does this mean that when we look what it's happening in evolution in evolution in evolution in evolution in evolution, and in particular, if we think of the place of human evolution evolution evolution thing, would I say that there's a lot more possibilities.
The first one is that not a <unk>
We've got a kind of <unk> balance.
And the one of the more underlying that through medicine, first of medicine, we have been known to preserve a lot of genes number of genes as much genes that would have otherwise been <unk> <unk>
And second, as a species, us us us us our own own environment environment to be adapted as adapted to us to be the <unk>
And by all, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> we have been not possible to have the necessary <unk>
A second possibility of is that a evolution the evolution of the natural type of the natural <unk> natural democracy, dictated by dictated by the dictated by <unk> forces.
And the argument here is, is, you is it that the motion of evolution evolution <unk> <unk>
And as much as a <unk> species like <unk> species, <unk> <unk> are going to be the power to be the isolation and <unk> the environmental changes changes changes changes changes changes change changes change change change change change change change change change changes change change change change changes change change change changes change change change changes change change change changes changes change change change changes changes change change changes
But there's a third possibility -- a rather aggressive possibility of intriguing and terrifying frightening.
I call the <unk> new evolution, which it's not just a <unk> and selected for us as individuals who as individuals that individuals in the decisions decisions.
Now, how could we happen this happen?
How could we be going to get it to come up with this?
First, let's just consider the reality that really many of the many cultures, people today, in making about the other way of the idea of their very offspring.
In some cultures, they are also choosing have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male to have more male
It's not necessarily a good good good good good good enough to be good for a good good good good to be good for a good good good thing to be good for a good good good thing to be good for a good good good thing to be good for a good good good thing to be good for a good good good thing to be good for a
So imagine you also be also possible to be able to be able to just be able to just be able only the sex in the <unk> sex, body <unk> <unk>
And if we could we make genetic the genetic changes to take out diabetes or Alzheimer's -- to reduce the risk of cancer cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want you like to make those changes on your <unk>
So if we look at the future that kind of more possible as possible.
The Human Genome Genome Genome Genome Human Genome <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The year next year we was finished, in 2004, I could actually be done the work work work for 20 for 20 million or four months.
Today, you can you now get a complete sequence sequence of the close cost base of the close cost fund of the next close cost base of the one cost cost of the next close cost base of 20,000 20,000 20,000 dollars, 20,000 and a week.
No matter of course, much to be a really much more of the reach of the reach of the reach more over.
They come up those changes. changes.
The same technology has been produced by make a virus that we viruses viruses virus that not only to protect protect themselves, but they will be going to protect us protect from their themselves, but protecting the protect of their themselves, but protecting of their themselves, but protecting protect them of the themselves, but protecting of the protecting of the themselves, but to protect immunity. of their themselves, but protecting
<unk> or there's a not a chance experimental trial in the flu vaccine <unk> <unk> cells in the cells cells from a plant plant in a <unk>
Can you imagine a good good thing to go from the <unk>
That's actually a reality today today, and the future is going to be become a more possible as possible.
Imagine that only one other other two <unk> <unk>
They can actually change the cells cells off their <unk> <unk> cells cells.
And if you could their change our children to change the sperm and <unk> <unk> and give their children their children a better chance of eliminate eliminate the <unk> reduce diabetes, <unk>
Who does it not like any children more <unk>
And then then that same same motor <unk> engine engine that there to allow us to be a better to allow us to adopt the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why would you not have the <unk> of Ken <unk> especially if you we was actually able to be <unk> with the next next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why would you not have an <unk> muscle faster than allowed us to run faster and <unk>
Why would you not to live longer?
This is going to be a <unk>
And when we are be in the conditions conditions to happen this to the next generation generation and we have the evolution evolution up before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that we you going to take a process that we going to take a process to take a process a process to take a process to take a process a process to take a process to take a process of a 1,000 years old and maybe it was a one 1,000 years old and maybe it was a one 1,000 years old, and maybe
These are the choices that their grandchildren, grandchildren, or grandchildren, or grandchildren, or the grandchildren their grandchildren their grandchildren, grandchildren, grandchildren, grandchildren, grandchildren, or <unk> are going to have the first one.
We're going to use these choice options options choices on the better better society, more <unk> <unk>
Or are we going to choose the <unk> different different attributes of the for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a much more boring and more more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind the kind of question that we're going to have that we go.
And most profound thing for all, we're going to be being able to develop the <unk> wisdom the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good for a good or for worse, these choices choices options are to be dependent away depend on to depend on to depend on to depend on to depend on to depend on to depend on
Thank you.
Imagine a huge explosion when you're in a 900 square feet of height.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay, I had a single one single one single one single one single one on <unk> <unk>
It was the only one one that could be talking about the <unk> <unk>
So I just immediately look at the look at them, and said, <unk> you probably you you a little <unk>
The pilot pilot were already <unk> the <unk> the plane, we were not us so far away. <unk>
You could you see up the Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened happened at the same time.
The pilot would the <unk> <unk> the Hudson pilot <unk> the Hudson <unk>
Often that's not the way the way.
So <unk> the <unk>
Imagine being being been a little bit of being being on a plane and <unk> <unk>
And then he said three three words ...
The three <unk> words that have been heard.
He said, <unk> <unk>
I didn't really have to talk about a talk more about the <unk> flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was be terror. Life <unk> Life <unk>
I want you to share with you three things to share with you three things that day to share about myself that day.
I learned that it all all the change in a second.
We have this list out ready to die, these are all the fences in the all the fences of the people people that I wanted -- come up and I didn't do it all the did, all the all the fences up the people other experiences experiences like <unk> <unk>
As soon as I was thinking more about a sentence, which is a <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine came up ready and he's going it up.
I don't mean <unk> anything in life.
And so I have really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is <unk> the George George <unk> <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to get better better than I did.
But in my humanity as I also give place a place my ego.
And I'm sorry the time that we were <unk> about the things with the people people people to care matter. matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then I like a <unk> in that, what I decided to get rid of the very negative energy energy energy on the negative energy energy <unk>
It's not perfect, but it's a much better thing.
In two years, I haven't had a fight a fight up with my wife.
It feels like a <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason -- <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- this is like your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk> you <unk>
I don't want this to be not like this to break up in 20 pieces of the <unk> <unk>
And while <unk> I was, I had the sense of, saying, Wow, <unk> <unk>
It's almost almost like that been a pretty much as much as we've been like we've been <unk> for for this whole whole life. life.
But it was very much sad.
I didn't really just love <unk> <unk> me, love me, <unk> <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> you in a single thought, which is just just a wish for one thing.
I wish could I be able to see my eyes to grow up.
A month later, I was actually a very much art <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to me, that was all the whole whole reason to be been the world.
So at that point I got to connect those two <unk> -- a great father. life.
For most of all, the only one more goal that I have in the life is be a good a good father. of life.
He gave me a miracle, not die that day.
And I gave me another one another gift to look at the future and come back and live on.
You are flying up today, the challenge the challenge you to you to imagine the the challenge challenge you to imagine that -- -- -- a -- a -- -- -- a -- the -- a -- a -- -- a -- but you can imagine, and how can it be <unk>
What is it that <unk> to <unk> they still still living on the living of <unk> <unk>
How would your change their change their relationships and negative energy energy change change on the <unk>
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've been clearly been <unk> in the life life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most great thing I worked was was a for this guy.
The guy's called the <unk>
<unk> was one one of one of the most major <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
One day he came up his house after a run, <unk> running and said, "Dad, feel a <unk> <unk>
And that was the first beginning of ALS.
<unk> <unk> has a complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a company design and animation so of course, graffiti is a intricate <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
And so we decided we were that we were going to spread the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I went on, and I met with his brother brother and his father brother and I said, "We're going to give you this little <unk>
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother brother said, "I just want you to be being been able to be able to talk about Tony <unk>
I just just want to be a power to communicate with it, and communicate with me."
And I said, <unk> I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I said, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say,
And he said, "No, unless you you you have a certain one very good one one to do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I was like, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Has anyone seen the film <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are always communicate in that way to be <unk> with your finger.
I said, "This is <unk> <unk>
So I was presented me to just be a check a check a check a check that I had the least a check that I didn't have the least a check that I have a check that there had the least the least more idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was <unk> you going to build a machine, and we're going to be a machine, and we just build a machine, and we're going to be a machine you going to build a machine, and we're going to be a machine you going to build a machine, and we're going to be a machine you going to build a machine, and we just build a machine, and we're going
Because it is a ridiculous one one that someone who have much be on the inside that <unk>
So I just talked about a conference a couple of months later, after later.
I met these guys known about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> technology to project projecting a light on the light on the light on any light on the light on any surface light on the light on any surface light on the light on the light on the light on
So they go over this way to make as this one.
All the things that <unk> -- they say, they say, <unk> <unk> they say, they're say, they're part of a life cycle of life.
They first start with the sex organs, then with the Bush attacks, people people start start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle life cycle in your <unk> life.
And so started the journey the journey.
And a few two years later, about about a year after later, about a year after that, about another year to other other other one side to another one side to another one on the side to another one next year later, we other had a couple of stuff.
One, <unk> to the doors to the doors of machine by <unk> could be <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk> <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is it a <unk> one <unk> because of the one one gets an email email from him, <unk>
The other one other thing that we did was actually come to bring up seven programmers to come up our home.
My wife -- the children and I, we move moved on the <unk> garage, <unk> and <unk> hackers and <unk> hackers and <unk>
Many of our friends thought that we do something totally be removed removed the frames off the walls walls and <unk>
But for a long <unk> we was <unk> we went on the big one, and we created this.
It's called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a couple of a couple of a clear sun <unk> ride and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> wire wire wire telephone pair of copper cell ride.
We took a quick <unk> camera -- <unk> we set it into a device that free -- -- the <unk> <unk> code software.
And we created a device that it not a limitation at all.
There is no a sure you that sure it tells you a sure you that <unk>
There is no hospital hospital to be a hospital that <unk> it can say.
Any person person has been access to draw and communicate with only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you that very much about that <unk>
So at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end
I love this picture because this is a room because this one is a room.
There was all all this whole <unk> and <unk> <unk> during the great <unk>
And then more of the two weeks of planning -- two weeks of programming, two intense intense intense of a long in seven years. of seven.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is a very wonderful thing, because this is a kind of <unk> support system support system system system system system support system support system support system system system support system system support system system support system system system support system system system support system of the life support support support system support system system system support system system system system support system
We ran the <unk> bed the bed the bed bed the bed <unk>
And we put a projector about a wall about a wall about a wall on a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he went back to draw for the first family and family family family and friends -- you know, you can imagine what the feeling feeling feeling the feeling the feeling a feeling in the parking lot.
The funny was that you we we had to measure the <unk> <unk>
And at the end of us to give us an email and sent us an email and said, "This was me, "This was the first first one one for seven in seven years. <unk>
I felt like a little finally been been been been been the underwater underwater <unk> coming to me out of where to me get me get out of that way to me get me out of where to me get me get out there to get me get out there to get me get out of there getting to me get me getting away from there getting out of there
It's not a <unk>
In a certain way that's our <unk> <unk>
That's what keeps us to get the motion, <unk> <unk> movement.
And we have a long way to run with this.
It's a great one, but it's the equivalent of <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential to deserve a much more.
So we're just trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and make it more <unk> and <unk>
Since we've been been all all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of <unk>
Remember, you guess remember, none of us not of us doing money money back.
It all all come out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk> <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about something about us and then then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one one of the 50 of the 50 best of 2010, 50 <unk> greatest <unk> of 2010, and was really great.
The best thing about all this thing about -- the <unk> ends <unk>
And <unk> you <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> <unk> urban art.
<unk> It's going to be a little going to be on the show which is pretty amazing.
So basically this point is idea: if you you see something something that it happen.
None of the one one what there is a possible one -- the <unk> stage, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Do it be <unk> anything like this room. room.
I'm not a programmer, I never done anything with <unk> <unk> technology. <unk> I simply just <unk> myself with wonderful people wonderful people to power it happen.
And these are the the questions that I want us all the questions that we feel feel about something that we feel feel feel about something that we feel feel feel about something that we feel feel feel about something that we feel feel feel about something that we feel feel feel about something that we feel feel about something that we feel feel feel about something that we feel
Thank you.
I have been spent in a often very difficult and same time as much dangerous.
I went into the hard <unk>
I worked up a <unk> mine in mine.
<unk> in <unk>
And I spent just a fun one fun at the very beginning, something that hard in the middle of the very very very end at the end.
In fact, as much of my career, I have been been <unk> up in social <unk> social questions in looking at a examining social issues social kinds of <unk> social issues in the <unk> social <unk> forms of <unk> social issues.
So when I knew that come out here to be a TEDTalk TEDTalk a TEDTalk up about the world of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, some of the may be been heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I got a <unk> <unk>
I emailed a few messages on Facebook, some over Twitter, offered you the name of the name of the name of my TEDTalk TEDTalk talk on the name of the name of my TEDTalk TEDTalk in the name of the name of my TEDTalk TEDTalk a TEDTalk a TEDTalk a TEDTalk <unk>
What was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But he said this -- it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the true.
And so I knew even people to know someone going to buy the military name.
If you had been asked a year ago, I was not ever been been been able to have been <unk> for <unk> <unk>
But in the new film that I'm been working, we looked at the world a marketing world <unk> world world a <unk> advertising.
And as I said before I say earlier, I've been put in the in the awful <unk> for something as hard or as dangerous as to go in the <unk>
You see, I have this whole idea for this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want you to do a film that to make a film that I do a film that we do about the <unk> of culture, marketing -- marketing and advertising, <unk> and that all the entire film is <unk> <unk> <unk>
The film is going to call "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
What happens is that happening in "The <unk> <unk> is that all the whole <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> each of the film to <unk> <unk> for the long time.
And so film it explores all the whole idea. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm just a <unk> <unk> <unk> only <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of <unk> X <unk> <unk> categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories of categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories categories
Maybe I go a <unk> a shoe and become the most more shoe <unk>
The most cool car that <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> So the whole idea is so besides showing the marks as part the part of life, life -- the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The whole film goal is full transparency.
You're going to see all the whole movie on this movie.
That's whole complete idea that whole complete idea, the whole shot of first end. to end.
And I would love me you that you to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know it's a funny because it's a first one as much of the audience audience.
<unk> But I don't know how much of the people people people people people have that.
<unk> You got a little <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's a very little <unk> but you sure about what it goes a <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: A one was a million people old, <unk> <unk> I think it's going to be a very hard to be worth the death worth a <unk> <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe you is maybe a lot of a lot of a lot of a bunch of <unk> a bunch of a bunch of <unk>
MS: What do you think about the answer the answer the answer the answer the answer the answer the answer the answer the answer?
Stuart <unk> The most majority <unk> The most majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of the majority of
MS: But will be going to be a hard be being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being going to be a hard be being being a hard to be I?
JK: The two things up.
MS: <unk> it means you're not a very great <unk>
So I just need me to get a help.
MK: I can be a way to help.
MS: All <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need you to think about what a <unk>
MS: Yes. <unk> That's <unk>
MK: We have a few places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: So I just think of course, the <unk> meant we got a conversation out of <unk> microphone.
<unk> The camera is <unk> the camera <unk> "We don't mean all of the <unk> <unk>
MS: And this was, one of one of all these entire companies suddenly disappeared. disappeared.
None of course nothing wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was a surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very much <unk> I thought this product as many people as possible as possible as possible.
Especially in the one this intersection of new media intersection of new new media, old media -- it's not the idea to count with this new <unk>
No, I was that really what I thought.
But the problem was, you can you that my idea had a <unk> error <unk> that one.
Not really no such a mistake.
There was no good at all.
This would have been been good.
But the problem was what this image image image of image image.
See, I see, you see, is this one of the first pictures that <unk>
I like the way you <unk> Sergey <unk> No. No.
This was a big one. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can you hear a lot about about transparency in these days.
Our politicians are <unk> the <unk> the <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But suddenly we actually actually be actually really a really a matter that really a matter really changes change change change happen.
But why? Well, the transparency <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>   -- like this weird <unk> path.
And it's also very risky. up a very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started me to talk about the time to talk to talk about companies to tell you to tell you that we wanted to tell this story <unk> history. <unk>
We want you to make a story, you a story, but <unk> <unk>
See, See, when I was a child a kid, and my father <unk> me just looking like it looking like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's your story, history, is my story, the story <unk> <unk>
As you can you actually tell the real story real.
But it was only just a company a company, an wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew it be known as only because I knew was only known as only because I knew only know John <unk> and Richard <unk> of course the <unk> <unk> of a many years old years old <unk> <unk>
So what I started a very much universal problem.
MS: So I have some friends friends with big big, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And my friends who make the great Hollywood Hollywood movies, <unk> to be so successful because the <unk>
And then my fellow friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, <unk> <unk> giant <unk>
And the film is called the greatest <unk> <unk>
How are we going to look specifically <unk> at <unk> in the movie?
Each time I'm going to go out, go out, every time I open my <unk> <unk>
At any other time for during an interview with someone someone to say, "You're very good cool for this <unk>
You're ready? you a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you to you, you will get a little <unk>
Maybe you should you be a little bit about put a little before <unk>
And so would you one about these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> you going to have their chance.
We're going to be a good for a man as for the <unk> solid, <unk> to <unk> in the bar, <unk>
That's the general one.
Now I can now take you your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're actually a little <unk>
They are <unk> the more <unk> films than <unk> we are more <unk>
That's why we don't have the budget to have another <unk>
So what do you do things like that, you you to remind you remind people be the reason for that interest in.
MS: What words used to describe the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> That's a big one.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way the way that you you to describe something something something out on the <unk> <unk>
Man: We talk about you talking about something very cool.
I think is a really a great thing I think <unk> it's a great word of <unk> category on the positive <unk> versus <unk> smell the smell of the <unk> smell of the smell of <unk> smell.
It's going to stay you over.
How do we we keep you keep you getting cool <unk>
Things like that <unk> <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? <unk> about the <unk>
I need you to talk you to talk about the <unk> man man to the people like me, the common <unk>
They have me talk about me to talk about my <unk>
MS: How about how do you define the <unk>
Man: I <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good food.
Woman: <unk> revive the 80s, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> revive the 80s, the 1980s, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: All right, what is it <unk> <unk>
<unk> Are you only <unk> <unk> <unk>
I like a lot about the dark colors, colors, lots of a lot of a lot of the many of the very many gray fish, like that way.
Usually I take you as <unk> <unk> <unk>
Woman: If you have to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I am, you would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman In part of the <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm kind of the kind of <unk> kind of the pet guy.
They <unk> toys for the country in the country and <unk>
So I guess that guess I guess I guess guess I guess I guess guess that I guess I guess guess that's my brand a brand a brand on.
In my small sector, that's my brand a brand on.
Man 2: My brand is a <unk> because I <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk>
Is this something?
<unk> I'm a <unk> <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we do not all the new Tom <unk> <unk>
I realized I need an an expert.
I needed someone somebody someone who could come into my head, understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were actually helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> to discover these <unk> <unk> personality personality.
If they were able to do it for that, for that for me.
<unk> <unk>
MS: Yes. The first first one was a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how to relate your thoughts and get feelings of the way it to be.
MS: So these people work a way to look at the world.
A: Tell me of the world up the world.
MS: So that world is -- the world I think of the world in the <unk> people as people your friends, your friends, your friends, the work work.
All those things come together, come and come into a place where come together, come and come in my family, family, <unk>
A: What is what the next senses is <unk> <unk>
MS: The next day in my life."
A: How does this relate your thoughts, feelings with your thoughts, feelings of <unk> <unk>
MS: That's what one who I was like to be a me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff to like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to tell you about the <unk> to tell us the <unk> to tell you what about that <unk>
What is the <unk> <unk> What you're you now? now?
Why is it important to <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> <unk>
Tell me a little about me a little about it.
A little more more of you, who is not who you you you who you you you you you you you. up.
What else would you about what other other <unk> you have it <unk>
You don't really not have to be being scared about -- what kind of a Russian <unk> you? are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> <unk> you, <unk> you, <unk>
A: Thank you.
MS: Yes, I don't know what it's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness about all this.
<unk> <unk> What first I was actually this idea this idea of the idea of the idea of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was very very much good together.
And I think that I think there's a much about a paradox of a paradox for them.
And I think of that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think of that I think that I think
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the actual <unk> nature to avoid avoid preventing the things to avoid <unk> the things to avoid <unk> the things to avoid <unk> the things back to avoid the those elements of fear positive for you, and is a nice nice to see that.
What other other brands is this?
The first one here is the classic <unk> Apple.
And you can also be also going to be also a big as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there's now a pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What is your <unk> <unk>
If you are someone asked you to break your brand into a brand, <unk> your personality personality into brand, <unk> the personality personality <unk> which would that be?
Are you someone to make the blood <unk>
Or are you you more good to be a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> are you like being playful to be a <unk> <unk>
Or are you you more about the <unk> attribute of <unk>
You are you aware of the sophisticated <unk> <unk>
Are you to be the traditional <unk> <unk>
You're going to be a wise as a wise as the Dalai Lama <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the course of this film was <unk> <unk> <unk> they didn't want a part of this project.
They didn't really have anything to have anything for control, you would not have no control control of the final product.
They let us tell us to tell us to tell us to tell us tell the <unk> history of <unk> <unk> and then we all tell the story story in this film of how that now you now tell the story story in a order to identify by identify the magnetic MRI to identify by identify the magnetic MRI to identify the magnetic MRI to identify the magnetic MRI to
We went to San Paulo where <unk>
In the entire city for the entire city for over the last five thousand years, there is nothing -- a <unk> no one <unk>
And we went to school school school school school school school school school school school school school available problems on the available problems.
The amazing thing for for me is that the projects for a much more success is the ones those in the ones that I've interacted the more success of stuff.
And that's what they made a <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> took up the <unk> took off their agencies, <unk> took me the better in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to be working with him to make a different other thing to challenge the way we look at the other way that we look at the people, the way we look at the people a challenge the way the way we look at the world.
And how has it left? <unk> <unk>
Okay, so since the film is sent from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
As <unk> the film was <unk> in January, -- we've been had 900 up with 900 of the <unk>
This is only a only one of a long time and a half.
That's just the <unk> and no TV game.
The film is still not a <unk>
It's not not online <unk>
It hasn't even even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has been already begun to win the momentum.
And it's not a bad because almost all of the good people to be not being a part of a one.
I always have always believed that if you to <unk> if you you to <unk> you take the risks of <unk> opportunities.
I think that when you do you think of that when you get one people people people people people to be the failure.
I guess you think that when we teach their teach their employees to <unk> loss loss averse preparing preparing for by risk of the risk of the risk risk of the entire company <unk> company company company to <unk> the <unk> risk company company being preparing preparing preparing preparing the <unk>
I feel like a matter that what it has a thing to happen to happen to happen to happen to happen to happen to happen to be a better for us people to encourage people to <unk> them.
We need you to encourage people to encourage the people people encourage people people to encourage the people people encourage the people people to encourage the people people encourage the people people to encourage people people encourage people people to encourage people the people encourage the people the people the opportunities opportunities are <unk>
Ultimately, we move on, move it forward, you to move on, I think we have a place to give the fear of fear.
We need you to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk>
From one <unk> at once, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we we we have been going to support the transparency.
More than many more than <unk> it's going to go a long way.
And I said this, with transparency, and transparency, all my good <unk> friends of <unk> <unk> rights.
<unk> <unk> Do you make a big great data data on the big opportunities for the entire world around the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
June June <unk> So I was <unk> the name of the <unk> <unk>
MS: That's a great fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the name of the TED <unk> <unk> Foundation, a <unk> <unk>
The idea behind the computer <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually really very simple.
We don't really want it to get the nuclear <unk> bomb.
Their biggest asset is to develop nuclear <unk> <unk>
The gray gray stuff that you see are the control control control system.
So if we do we be able to compromise these systems to <unk> and <unk> we can have a cause a lot of a lot of a lot of other problems with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> gray boxes don't use software to be a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows on a laptop engineer to set this gray, <unk>
This is the plan behind behind the <unk> <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> comes into the gray, box, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It's easy, <unk> <unk>
I want to tell you what we discovered this.
When we started a research research about six months ago, six months ago, the purpose is absolutely completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is is a really very complex at the <unk> part of the <unk> -- using multiple <unk>
It seemed like a seem like to do something like something with these <unk> boxes. <unk>
That was called us the attention, and we started a experiment with <unk> the <unk> environment environment and <unk> and we saw what we see what it was what we saw what it was what what we see what it happened with it.
So they were a very weird thing.
They were <unk> just like a single <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't have any sense of a sense for me.
And then I just experiment with different experience with different very different <unk> attack. attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is being actively looking to actively be active in the specific setup and even even if the program is actually going to actually be actually actually working on working in that <unk>
If not, <unk> it doesn't happen.
So I that was called my attention, and we just start working on this almost 24 hours of 24 hours hours hours hours a day, because we -- is a <unk> you don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be be, let's say, let's say this for example, a plant of plant energy energy energy energy chemical energy chemical plant plant plant in the U.S. energy plant in the U.S., <unk> chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry <unk> Germany. Germany.
We'd better need you to break the target off the goal soon.
So we then pulled away and <unk> the code code code and attack the code code code and the code code code code code code code, and we found that it was a <unk> at two <unk> <unk> <unk>
We also also see that these very <unk> very <unk> <unk>
<unk> all all the points you to attack.
You probably probably probably even know know how much it was the <unk> <unk>
So you know it happen.
And if you have you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell
It's very much above all of what we've seen before.
Here you look at a sample of this piece of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand <unk>
It looks like old as old <unk> <unk>
I want to tell you how we could we be found sense the sense of the way we were able to find the sense of the code.
What we were looking at the first as called the function of the system in the system, because we know what what do we know what they do what they do.
And then we were a few <unk> and structures data data and structures of the real real potential of the actual real world, real potential goals.
We need the theories theories theories about <unk> to pass or <unk>
In order to come to theories about goals to remember that it's a definitely a violent <unk> to be a white <unk> and it's probably sure quite sure that a white white white infections infections of infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections of the infections
They are not a lot of many thousand of a many thousand of the in that area.
It basically basically basically boils down the <unk> nuclear power plant from <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I then said it to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
I called the <unk> and <unk> and tell you them in an effort to <unk> the experience in code code and data.
And it worked pretty much good.
So we were actually been able to associate the little digital <unk> with control the <unk> control.
rotor <unk> is that this little black object to see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> <unk> <unk> you certainly you can actually actually even even make it that the <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we also found is also a really a slow <unk>
We tried we try and try we try and we try and try we try and we try and try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try we try and we try
So for instance, the number <unk> shows you in that code, you can't be <unk> up.
I started a research a research scientific literature on <unk> and I found that they find that very <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, a coincidence.
And it was better better better yet.
These are <unk> in Iran in Iran in 15 pieces of <unk>
And guess what we do you guess what we found on the code code code.
A lot of a pretty almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was again, a good coincidence.
This was given a lot of a really a lot of a really a lot of understanding the hands on the hands of hands.
And so I don't have it just like this.
The results results have been taken away that after many many weeks of hard job.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even so, we discovered that both digital <unk> digital <unk> <unk> <unk>
The little <unk> little is a little <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined that <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just just a <unk> thing.
We shouldn't we worry about worry about the other things other goals goals goals goals goals goals goals goals of <unk> <unk> for <unk>
Here I show you show you some very interesting things to <unk> me.
There's a gray, box and gray, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What does this thing is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And believe it or not, these false <unk> are <unk> <unk>
It's kind of like the in the film film where, during the <unk> security camera feed feed out of a <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only just to <unk> the operators up the operators to the operators of the operators up the <unk> <unk> room.
It's really a really much more dangerous to <unk>
The idea is <unk> a <unk> a <unk>
We need a digital information system of digital <unk> <unk>
For example, at a example, in a plant of energy when the great great steam of vapor steam steam turbine tubes.
Obviously, this is not really a human <unk>
That's where we needs a digital <unk>
And when they're <unk> so you can it happen a bad stuff happen.
The plant can <unk> be exploit.
And I don't have the <unk> security safety system <unk> safety <unk> safety <unk>
That scares me.
But it may be be even worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This <unk> <unk>
It has nothing to see it, specifically, <unk> <unk>
Could it be work as well, for example, in a power plant, plant, plant of energy energy energy energy, or a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have a lot of <unk> <unk> that will disseminate with the case of the one of the case of <unk> <unk>
You could also be using conventional technology technology technology <unk> to <unk>
<unk>
And if you made it that, with what <unk> <unk>
That's the consequence we a consequence that we are we face.
Unfortunately, unfortunately, the most number of the most of the such a Middle Eastern <unk> attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the U.S. and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces spaces, <unk>
We must face the face the <unk> and better better we that we are now going to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Do I have a question.
<unk> has been been a big in a many place on the way of this.
What is your <unk> <unk>
Ralph <unk> <unk> Okay, actually really really really hear about this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is is, the <unk> <unk> <unk> is not a <unk>
The engine back behind this is <unk> <unk>
There's one of all, and that's the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because, in the other way our problems would be even even even bigger problems.
CA: Thank you, <unk> Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that you is imagine a robot a robot that you can you imagine a robot you to imagine a robot you to imagine a robot you to imagine a robot you to imagine a robot you to imagine a robot you to imagine a robot you to just raise a place and come back.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk> <unk>
It's not a different about something different about a great force that is also increasing at the their help to help -- for example, how to drive your speed and help support the balance.
It's actually a real true of man and the machine.

This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now to get a even more more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to be led to some of the important complications of the back, 30 percent of the soldiers 30 of the soldiers soldiers soldiers <unk> <unk>
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that help handle the matter.
Let me you you to introduce you the <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> <unk>

And this has been like this for the last 500 <unk> as -- as a successful <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility. about mobility.
Let me introduce you the <unk> <unk>
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: <unk> Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has a few sensors.
It completely doesn't <unk> us in the computer on the computer computer on board, on board, on the YouTube computer here.
There is also a few power to the motors of <unk> <unk> and very <unk> <unk>
AB: <unk> 24 24 years old at the top of the top of the air air, <unk> leap in the air and air, <unk> <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all the whole sense of <unk> <unk>
Soon I was a doctor never one coming of <unk> <unk>
That was happened 19 years ago.
So I was actually a way to last last last bit of hope of my being.
The technology technology has been ever been allowed to learn <unk> costs the <unk>
But they haven't been absolutely not allowed to walk, the way up now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can you you all the technology we get the technology technology, we have the platforms to sit sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit and sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to sit to

AB: Thank you.
I just just come up with a community that secret survival survival -- the secret human survival.
This is a place where women women have <unk> practice sex to say, sex to say hello, and the game is a day that day -- where the <unk> is thing.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man <unk> festival, or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know you know know about their <unk>
This is this the world in the world in the wild rainforests of the <unk> rainforests <unk>
The bonobo ones are with the chimps, with chimpanzees, with chimpanzees, with chimpanzees, with chimpanzees, <unk> <unk> closest <unk>
That means that means that all we share a common ancestor, human ancestor, one about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for for their <unk> <unk>
But unfortunately, we've been a much more emphasis on place on this part aspect of the aspect of look on the aspect of what in our narratives of human evolution narratives of human evolution evolution.
But the bonobos tells us you the other side of the currency.
Whereas while the chimps chimps chimps chimps the Bonobo society society with a power society.
These guys have been created something special -- because this leads us to a very tolerant death to be been <unk> up.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live live on the deep <unk> <unk> <unk> and has been very difficult to <unk> it.
The Congo is an <unk> an <unk> land land biodiversity beauty, <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> scenario violent war conflict conflict conflict conflict conflict conflict that has been been nearly as much as the <unk> <unk>

By <unk> like humans, as humans, they love play play play play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play with play a game play with play
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for the game for and for the game is fundamental to set up the <unk>
And we learn the <unk> and we learn how to <unk> and we learn the <unk> and we learn the <unk> and we learn the <unk>
The game game comes the creativity and resilience comes the creativity increases and the resilience of the diversity of diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity.
And when you look at the Bonobo is see the <unk> roots of <unk> dance and the human human.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how about how do you play you a few of the first old couple of the wild environment.
First of all, it's a game game <unk> <unk>
Here we have a female a female and a male young male in the one <unk>
Look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look
Could it be be the actual origin end of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think of the case he loves -- the love, isn't it?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as common in humans.
And this video is really interesting because we actually <unk> this really interesting because it shows the the invention of game of bringing in particular unusual <unk>
But the game is a <unk>
The game is <unk> <unk> can we take a many of the many times forms, some of which many ways, of which which are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I want you to be <unk> this -- a young female female female female female female female female female female -- playing with a young, female female.
I think like that, we sometimes to play with themselves, and we explored the limits the limits the limits in inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that led us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections connections unexpected connections unexpected connections unexpected unexpected connections connections the unexpected connections unexpected connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections connections that the unexpected connections connections connections connections connections the unexpected connections unexpected connections connections
These are only small samples of the understanding of the understanding of our past the past the past the past and past and past the past and past the past the past and past it. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But they also have a secret to have a secret for our future -- a future where we we have to adapt a more to adapt to a better and more difficult creativity cooperation.
The secret is that the game the game is the key of the game the game of the game the game of the game of the game of the game.
In other other words, the game is the game our <unk> <unk> <unk>
To try to adapt very successful a world as success to a successful world that changes changes is <unk> play.
But we do it look at the maximum as much as much of our <unk> <unk> capability.
The game is not a <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos for the for Bonobos and human human lives is not only to just be just a <unk> just it's just the cruel and <unk> <unk>
When we look at least the very appropriate appropriate thing to play, you can be the times more urgent <unk>
And so <unk> we colleagues <unk> accept accept this let's accept this of the evolution of evolution evolution and <unk> and friendship and friendship friendship and <unk>
Thank you.
In New York I'm a responsible for a development of a development development called Robin Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting the poverty, <unk> <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers to lead them a highly <unk> staff to the fire site a very very long time to go into action. action.
I remember first my first fire.
I was a very good volunteer in to go.
But there was still a race to stand up against the other volunteers volunteers to captain and figure out what what do our work.
When I was found up the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> owner days of his life.
We were just at the full night night, she was standing up the rain, <unk>
The other one one one one was one more volunteer before I get before -- <unk> <unk> come first to the captain and <unk> the dog home.

There I was a <unk> a lawyer or <unk> money that during the rest of his life, life, life, I would have a tell you to tell the people to get a live being being being a day to tell the one up a live being being being been a live only because he made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
And the captain makes me a <unk>
He said, <unk> <unk> I need you you not to come back the home.
I need you to be a <unk> the fire, and bring up this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected -- but <unk> <unk> I went on the end of the end of the end of the end of the summer end, the hall hall, hall, rainy <unk> got to the <unk> fire fire <unk> <unk>

Everything is all your importance.
So when I look at the people people people people have been done -- by the one of the <unk> levels extraordinary this: this: <unk>
They don't don't wait to win the difference in a difference in life life.
If you have something that you have a good for a <unk> to give you you to be <unk>
They were <unk> food food into a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
They've been mentors.
Not every day we are going to have the chance to save save the one day we are going to be able to influence the power to influence your life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes it back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may be seem a strange, but I'm a big fan of the block of the concrete <unk>
The first first concrete blocks was built up with <unk> with a very simple idea of a very simple idea a simple very simple idea of a very simple idea of a very simple idea a simple very simple, very very simple idea a very simple idea of a very simple idea a simple idea of a very simple idea a simple <unk> modules in a very very very very
Very very quickly, these became the unit of building the more more building in the world.
They have been allowed us to build the bigger things to build up the buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or buildings buildings or buildings buildings buildings, or
So essentially, these blocks have been become the <unk> blocks of time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, and came this happen.
He was called the <unk> <unk>
And within a few years, the <unk> bricks building building <unk> set for all the home.
It's been estimated that that been been been been been been been been been been been been been estimated that more more been been estimated that over 400 billion bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks bricks building per person on the planet.
There's not to be an engineer to build beautiful to build beautiful <unk> buildings.
<unk> made it accessible. <unk>
<unk> I simply just adopted the block the block -- the <unk> <unk> of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly exactly the same year in the Bell labs, Bell, exactly the new <unk> new block block of constructed.
The transistor is a little little plastic unit of aesthetic aesthetic piled about a more about other to a world where it's all all interactive.
Just like the block the block of concrete, the transistor lets you make a much more more complex and more more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference in <unk> difference, just to only be experts.
I personally don't personally believe it not really tell us that the building blocks to the experts, <unk> so I decided to change it.
About eight years old years ago, when I began to explore the power of the power of computer engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started a few years ago, I started a a few years ago, started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how to work.
<unk> <unk> are you electronic modules each with a specific function.
They are a little <unk> to be being light, sound, sound and sensor motors and sensors.
And the best thing is all the best part of all that that they're together together together together together along with magnets.
So I don't really be put up the wrong way.
The bricks line bricks have a colors.
The green is the stream, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we just just just have just to just be only to just put up a blue with a very quickly you going to start to make the larger circuits.
A blue is a blue with one green to light.
Can we put a button in the middle and a <unk> <unk> button a <unk>
So if we change it change the button a little bit of the <unk> light button a button a <unk> light.
We were <unk> this <unk> to create more <unk>
I'm going to stop this out.
So beyond the simple <unk> game, <unk> are actually really a really really a really very much powerful.
Instead of <unk> way we have to show you to connect the <unk> connect us using very simple <unk>
To make a <unk> you to just be this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea the idea behind the <unk> is that it's a spread that it's a <unk>
We want you all that all the things we want all the things we want all the things we want you all of you to use up the <unk> bricks building to use to use. use. use.
<unk> <unk> panels, <unk> you all have everything up. <unk>
We have <unk> <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience. experience.
The best bit better is how how they you start the learn in schools.
For example, how does it work a night daylight. <unk> <unk> get open open, or how one iPod one iPod is an iPod a iPod an iPod an iPod an iPod an iPod a iPod an iPod to touch.
We also have been <unk> to design <unk> schools.
So for instance, designers the designers game designers start to play with <unk> as a material.
So here you can you be seen a little bit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took a couple of the designers designers designers designers designers design design design <unk> <unk> design of <unk> that have any experience of engineering, only in a few of wood and wood and paper -- we said, do you you them to say, have it to make a happen.
Here's an example of a project that there is actually done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But hang on, here's my my favorite project. project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that the darkness.
For these engineers, not engineers, <unk> became become a another material.
And we want this material to be the reach for the end of all of all.
And so, <unk> it has an open open.
You can be a part of the head the page the page, website, download and <unk> design
We want to encourage you a world of creators, inventors inventors and we live in, this interactive <unk> world.
So I'll go ahead again, and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk you about the unexpected discoveries of <unk>
I work the work in the solar technology.
And my little research is looking for to get involved with the environment environment the environment environment the environment environment the environment environment the environment environment the environment environment focus on the <unk> environment.
<unk> <unk>
This is a little clip of what we doing about.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can a little bit about a <unk>
<unk> we can be going to continue a better continue a better be better to be the better side side side.
Nope.
This is not ...
All right.
<unk> technology.
Oh, I am you now a time a time ...
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of a couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to launch the best designers and work in an environment environment environment.
The initiative was called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> be <unk> for the <unk>
We were a few members of members of a few members of year and we were put it to work with the <unk> <unk>
And instead instead of they we send them you to the Third World States we send them the <unk> world.
They worked great <unk> they worked with the <unk> <unk>
Your task is about showing you the possibilities of current technology today.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
Here it comes up a bit like this to be a look for a look at a quote, <unk> someone to clean up the snow away from the snow because he is known that not a very good very good one to the snow away off the snow because he gets caught up the snow snow, because he knows it's not very good a very good very good a good
How did it be been help for this way to <unk>
Last year in Boston we we a team of <unk> members for <unk> members <unk> <unk>
They were all that there in February times, and at a very long last year.
They realized that the city was realized that the city never cleaned wiped away wiped away wiped wiped cleaned away wiped cleaned wiped away the <unk> cleaned wiped away the <unk> cleaned wiped away the <unk> cleaned cleaned away the <unk> cleaned cleaned away the <unk> cleaned cleaned away the <unk> cleaned wiped away the <unk> cleaned cleaned away the <unk> cleaned wiped away the <unk> cleaned cleaned away the
But one of the fellow members of members of <unk> Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik Erik <unk> <unk> citizens with <unk> them <unk> on the right face of one of them.
So he made it as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice big application where to adopt a <unk> <unk>
Do you take a <unk> when a <unk>
When you do is a name, <unk> in this case <unk> <unk>
If you do you you not do that, someone someone else can <unk> be <unk>
I mean, it has a little one one one a one a little bit of a video itself.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the tiniest little bit of the smallest <unk> applications last year.
But does something something that any other technology of the <unk> <unk> technology. technology.
And it spreads <unk> form.
A responsible to system of <unk> city <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> <unk> batteries.
So why is the citizens citizens citizens to <unk> them <unk>
And then Seattle was decided to use it to be used to make the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just a <unk> to make people be clear by being clear on the <unk> sidewalks when <unk>
So now we know now we know about nine now know about nine now know of nine know about nine of nine now know about nine now know of nine know about nine in nine cities using using it.
And this has been spread without a <unk> <unk>
If you know you a little as a part technology technology technology to know that, it doesn't happen normally happen.
The acquisition of software is usually a couple of years old.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on for two and a half months.
It was a tool for a long for so that parents to pick up the best public school best in public school best public school best public school their best public school best public school would their children. <unk>
And then they were told that been done by the normal <unk> channels of <unk>
And that's not nothing.
Now this is now a project in the <unk> <unk> project that to the time -- 2,000 million dollars dollars and doesn't work.
And there's a projects like this on this on every level of government.
And so an app that program a program up a program in a couple of a couple of the program in a viral form of <unk> <unk>
It suggests the government to be the government to be better to the government <unk> like a many people people thinking that it be.
Nor do it also be also not like a technological as a technological <unk> the Internet.
I mean, don't <unk> be open up open the open and open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is app that the whole new <unk> not as a a <unk> <unk>
And that's very good because it turns out, it a happen to happen as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result as a result
And there is a very big community of very large very large a very big community of people who involved together with it together with efficacy.
And it's not only a <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people in all the entire country happened all the country the country country the country happened on the country country the country happened on the country <unk> <unk>
They haven't have been given to me about the government.
They feel so much a great one with one to that -- the <unk> <unk>
And these people know something something that we've lost from view.
And what is it that if we we left up the feelings on politics, the <unk> they are all the government all the government on the government is essentially a words of the words of the words of Tim <unk> <unk>
Now a lot of many people people have abandoned the government.
If you're just ask you to ask you to ask you you to ask you to be <unk> it to the <unk> because the <unk> because of the <unk> because the <unk> because the <unk> because of the <unk> because the <unk> because of those things <unk> because the stuff is that, because things <unk>
<unk> policy is not <unk> the government <unk>
And because the government ultimately made the result that the government ultimately to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I didn't know a lot very much of the government when I started me with this.
And as many people thought that the government was a choice to pick up the people <unk> <unk>
Well, after about two years old, I have come to the conclusion to the conclusion that the government is especially <unk> about <unk>
This is the center one the center of telephone and information center center and information center is the center of <unk> information center center and the information information.
This is a place the place the calls calls <unk> <unk>
Scott <unk> this is called this phone call.
He joined the <unk> at the official of official of official of the official of the official of the official of the official of official of official of official of the official of official of official of official knowledge.
I didn't find them it up with an animal.
And he finally finally said you can you open the doors door to put music very strong and <unk> to see if it <unk>
And it worked. So it worked. So worked. <unk> it <unk>
But that was not the end of the <unk> end of the <unk> <unk>
Boston does not have a call a center.
It has a mobile application, and has a <unk> <unk>
You won't <unk> that app.
It was be the work for a very smart job from New <unk> <unk> Office of New York <unk> Bureau <unk> <unk> in of Boston.
One day, this was really a <unk> <unk>
How do I do make you be <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> is <unk> different.
Scott was talking on a person.
In <unk> <unk> everything everything is <unk> public, <unk> <unk>
In this case, they seen it a neighbor neighbor.
The next report, the next report, said, "I'm going to come up the <unk> garbage behind the home.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yeah.
And I gave the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. That's the confluence of digital and physical physical.
And it's also a great example of the government to <unk> the government to <unk> government to <unk> government to <unk> the government to <unk> the government government to <unk> government to <unk> the government to <unk> the government government to <unk> income government to <unk> the government to <unk> the government government to <unk> the government government to <unk> <unk> government to <unk> the government to <unk> the government
But it's also a great example of government a platform.
And I don't necessarily necessarily mean the definition of the definition of the <unk> platform.
I'm talking about a platform for that people help others be <unk> up with each other and help others.
So, a citizen helped the other one helped another one, but here the government got a key one.
I connected the two people.
And I might have it be connected to be connected with the very best more better <unk>
When I was help for the other, <unk> <unk>
If we call the control of the control control of that costs a much more money.
One more important thing we have to think about the government is not the same thing as politics.
A lot of a lot of people people <unk> it, but you're thinking about the input to input from the other.
That our input to the system system system is the vote. <unk>
How many times you have been chosen to the pick up a choice a new political leader and <unk> values values values values values values values, values values values values values, values values, values together.
That's because the government is a huge ocean of the immense ocean ocean of the <unk> surface <unk>
So below this is what what we called <unk> <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> thing to keep us that that into our against that other thing, is going to operate on our against the other one -- -- that other other thing, is going to operate in our against the other thing, and a one one one, and a a result is that a result of it.
People are thought politics sexy. sexy.
If we want this way to work to be a sexy.
Because it is a place where the real government is happening the true government. of government.
We need you now to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement movement. movement.
They've been <unk> up.
This is a group of citizens concerned concerned about concerned about concerned about concerned that written a report with a very very very very very very very very very very very very a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very a very very very very very very a very very very very very very
That's not a political activism is not a political activism care of the <unk>
And for the one time for the one time to be <unk> us to the way to the government, is time for time to ask ourselves, what world to leave our children.
You need you to look at the big challenges challenges that we are we face.
They really really really really believe that we get to get to get a fix the institution to act on the <unk> <unk>
We can't we do no challenge of government, we need it to be be more more effective.
The good news is that with technology to rethink the technology is possible to rethink the result of the governance function of the governance function function system so that can it be <unk> the <unk> <unk> society.
There's a generation to come up with the Internet the Internet and <unk> is only just to articulate the systems the right way.
The average age of age of age age of old members of members of the 28 members of the <unk> members members of them.
This is a generation that's been grown up with taking by taking the word and <unk>
They're not going to be a little battle that you talk about.
They can you express their opinions into any channel channel in any channel channel time and they are doing it.
So why is it when they face the problem problem on the government doesn't really care about to hear their voices.
They're just using your hands.
They were both both the work to work better for the government.
And so many applications allow us to use our hands with better improve our communities.
It may be be a washing away <unk> <unk> <unk>
Of course we were always been able to have clean the <unk> and a lot of people people it.
But these applications are be a much possible digital <unk> that we are only because we are not only to just be only to only be only as consumers, we are only the consumers, to not only are we only to just be just not only as much the government government governance government government government government to tax the government tax tax taxes the tax taxes the taxes tax taxes
We're more more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until <unk> <unk>
So I want you to ask you all of the big one, when when about the important things that we are we be going to be be being being going to be be being being going to be a swarm of voices of voices, or <unk> of the crowd of the voices of the voices of voices, or <unk>
Thank you.
This is a for me a true honor.
I've spent the much more part of the happening in the prisons, <unk> death row row part of the time in the prisons, <unk> death row.
I've spent the much more part of my life in <unk> and places is a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be a good at TED by seeing and hearing about these <unk> me a lot of energy.
One of the many things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED with identity.
And the things that they are say here you the impact on the whole impact impact impact on the entire world.
In occasions, if something come up with it a sense of a sense and a force force force force that not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity identity identity identity identity identity identity identity matters important.
So here's the fantastic <unk>
And I think that I think we've learned that the words very much sense, but they can you have a special meaning.
A doctor can be a good doctor to do good good things, <unk> it can be a much more much more.
And so I want to talk about about the power of the power of identity.
And I actually actually actually not learned this on the practice of law, my job.
I learned about my <unk>
I grew up a lot of traditional family family family family, dominated by a <unk> <unk>
It was a strong one, it was a strong power. of power.

Her parents were born in the slavery to <unk> fathers were born in <unk> who were born in the <unk> <unk> fathers born in slavery in Virginia <unk> <unk>
She was born over the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the way as I looked like this.
She was also a hard one, but it was also a <unk>
When I was a little little and looked at it, she was giving me a good for a good one. of mine.
I was just <unk> so hard to breathe on, and <unk> me back.
A or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or two or
And if I said it was said no, I was a really fun again and I was just <unk> it in peace.
I had this quality human being always going to wish being close to be close with it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was a younger than 10.
Sometimes, I was just a time when I was a long time with it, it was not easy to get his time to get your time to get your time to get your time to get your time to get your time to get your time to get your time to capture their time.
My cousins were running all all over.
I remember when I remember it was about eight -- nine years old, I went into the room room and went into the room room -- I went the room to the room room, and I went the room to the room room -- I went the room to the room room -- I went the room to the room room -- I went the room to the room and
My grandmother was one to the other side of the room and looked like me <unk>
And at the first thought that was a play game.
And then he looked like it, and I read her, it was her very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she stood up the room and <unk> me <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember just remember this as if it was going to be that outside that outside that outside yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out me, and said, <unk> you will you say it it to say it <unk>
I said, "All <unk> <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I was like, <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked like me to <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> you are that you're <unk>
He said, "I think guess you can you think of you ever you can do what it <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just just want you to tell you three things <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first first want you to your <unk> your mother."
<unk> "She <unk> <unk> is always the <unk>
As I was <unk> my mom, I say, "Yes, you like it <unk>
Then he said, "All the second thing I want you all the good right thing -- <unk>
I thought, I say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then finally he finally finally said, "The <unk> <unk> third thing I want you all <unk> <unk>
I was a nine years old, and I said, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field in <unk> <unk> <unk> I have a brother more year older and a younger one.
When I was 14 my day home with a six <unk> <unk>

He took a sip of beer, he offered a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. it was <unk> you, I'm not going to take a <unk>
My brother said, <unk> do you always do the same thing as we did.
I was also a <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> I don't really feel a few good good guys that <unk>
Then my brother looked like me as <unk> me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? take a <unk>
And I was one the look at the strength look of the strength and <unk> <unk> you not be still thinking about the conversation with <unk> <unk>
I said, "But what are you what you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all all the grandchildren that <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to say a thing to admit a thing to just admit something about something about something about to you.
I'm going to tell you one that you probably not supposed to say.
I know this be spread a spread a <unk>
But I am I ever admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't mean this <unk> <unk> I'm saying about the power of <unk>
When we do we create the right kind of the right kind of identity, we say things all any sense.
We can't we get them to do things things be to be done.
I think of the way I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all their grandchildren special special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner been inmate during the <unk> <unk>
My <unk> died of the diseases diseases diseases alcohol.
And these were the things the things that that, according to her, we have a lot of <unk>
Now, I'm going to try to talk about our attempt to talk about about our criminal justice justice system system. system.
This country is a very, very different years ago. years ago.
In <unk> you had 300,000 <unk>
Today are you about 2.3 million today.
In America we we we have the biggest incarceration rates of incarceration incarceration incarceration incarceration in the America is the world's greatest <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have a seven million people people in a <unk> <unk>
And this massive mass in my opinion, has changed fundamentally changed fundamentally our world.
In the poor poor people or black, you are a certain of despair a determined despair for these facts.
One of every one of every three in the 18 and 30 18 years old is in a prison or in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison in prison with a
In urban urban <unk> people all the young color of color are in prison in jail in prison in prison in jail jail in jail jail in prison in jail in jail in jail in jail in prison in prison in prison in jail in jail jail in jail jail in jail jail in jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail jail
Our system is not only only to only only be only about poverty. poverty.
In this country we -- you is a much better better and innocent.
It's not a <unk> but wealth the results results <unk>
And it seems to be really a really very <unk> we feel very <unk>
<unk> policy and anger and anger are we us to make us believe these people to believe this not to believe that these are not trouble problems problems.
We're <unk>
I find myself interesting.
We're looking at our some work done well curious.
In my state, in the state of the state in the state of the state in Alabama, as about in other other states, rights rights, whether you you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, right now in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the black mother right to vote. it.
And if we projected it to the the level of the level of the rights level of <unk> rights to be being a before that before we get <unk> <unk> -- the law of the right <unk>
We have this amazing one.
I represent the children.
A lot of course many of my very customers very young people.
America is America the only one country of the one 13 child dying to die die in prison. in prison.
We have a lot of the one in this country prison for -- a long chance of coming out again.
Right now we are now a lot of a process of a process of a process in a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process of a process
The only one country in the world.
They were <unk> people people in the death death row.
This is the issue issue worth dying is interesting. interesting.
In some sense of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of the people to think of the people people to think of the people people people think of the dying <unk> die die of the <unk> <unk>
A lot of a very sensitive question.
But you can you think of the way other other way to how we are we in our identity.
There's a different way to <unk> this is not to be a better to decide if people people people deserve to die for the <unk> crimes crimes crimes of <unk> to <unk>
This is interesting.
The death death death is defined by mistake. by mistake.
From every nine <unk> people has been identified with one innocent and liberated from the death row.
A second <unk> error, is an innocent of each nine. nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation that it was never been allowed to be never been going to be <unk>
But somehow we was a really close about the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about about these things.
I'm talking about race and from this matter about race to deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my students classes in student <unk> students, students talk to talk about slavery, of slavery.
I'm going to talk about you about the terrorism, the time started at the very end end of the reconstruction rebuilding and reconstruction rebuilding of rebuilding and <unk> rebuilding and that lasted for the way to World War.
We don't really know a lot very much about this.
But for the most black in this country, was a very defined by <unk>
In many people people people people have been afraid of being <unk>
They were concerned about being <unk>
The terror of the terror is what what defined their lives lives.
Now there are these people older people to get me close and say, say, <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk> the people people to stop saying that true <unk> people to stop the people people stop saying that stopping about saying that in our deal other story cope with <unk> <unk> <unk>
They ask me that you to say, you say, <unk> <unk>
The age was a part of the <unk> went on, obviously, with segregation <unk> <unk> and of separation. of separation.
In this country we a country we have a dynamic that we really not talking about our problems.
We don't do not like a talk about talking about our story.
And this is why we haven't understood the significance of what historically historically historically historically historically understood that. of the significance of what historically done historically done.
All the time we come up close with each other.
We are constantly constantly creating and create <unk>
We are really a work work to talk about what a lot of a really a process of true truth and reconciliation. and reconciliation. is reconciliation.
In South Africa, people people really understood that not overcome overcome overcome the <unk> race of the truth of <unk> truth to the truth and reconciliation. the reconciliation. is reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even even before the genocide have this commitment, we have done it.
And I was been in the death talk talk on about death death.
And it was a fascinating because one of the teachers two after my presentation and said, "Do you know you know you know know it know you know you know you know you know know it know you know you know know it know you know it's a good good good good good good good good good to hear what that <unk>
<unk> We're not not a dying of death of death in Germany. of death in Germany. the death death of dying in Germany. the death death on the death in Germany. of you dying of death in Germany. the death death in Germany. in Germany. of the death death in Germany. the <unk> death death in in Germany. the <unk> death death of death in Germany. the <unk> death death
<unk> we will never be never be it.
The room was stayed the silent and a lady lady -- we can ever ever be ever ever ever ever ever to get into the systematic death. of <unk>
It would be irrational that us, intentional and <unk> to give us us to be a kind of a set of <unk> the <unk>
<unk>
How would we be <unk> us in a place where a <unk> nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation nation
We could not be <unk> it.
Would it be be a irrational.
And yet, it is even even even like that, there is the such one that is such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a been such a happen like that, there is that been such such that disconnection. as disconnection.
I think of our identity is that our identity to be in danger.
If we don't really really worry about these things that hard hard -- <unk> <unk>
We love us love the innovation.
We are fascinated the technology to <unk> the creativity.
We love us love the entertainment.
But lately, those really strong reality realities people are because of the suffering, <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need you that necessary to integrate both these two things.
lately we are often talking about the need to have more much more of the most basic animal life of life this complex world.
I think that means you to spend more more about thinking about thinking about the poor, people the poor, the <unk> people that never come to TED. TED.
And if you think of a thinking of think of the sort of a certain kind of sort of a sort of sort of a kind of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a sort of sort of a
It is really true that we us to believe this belief that we have to believe this belief that we have been not seen it.
So we are, even though it is being <unk> so rational to be so rational, very rational, very rational, so rational, very rational, with intellectual <unk>
And development development comes from not only of the brain idea.
So these things come up with the heart rate of the heart rate of the heart.
This is a connection between mind with the heart is what drives us to be not just the brilliant and dark and <unk> thing.
<unk> <unk> The great great leader leader <unk> talked about this.
He said, "When did we be <unk> as long as we was been hope, hope, of the orientation to the spirit, one will -- a will be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be a willingness to be being a <unk> will <unk>
Well, that kind of <unk> orientation orientation orientation spirit orientation orientation spirit orientation orientation orientation spirit of which I think, even in communities communities like TED TED, I think, is still in communities communities like TED, the TED TED <unk> <unk>
There's nothing about the related technology technology to allow us to be truly human enough to poverty, you to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of
Now I want you to warn you that these thoughts things make a much more challenging identity, a a much more identity identity identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity a identity a identity identity identity
We go back back back back back to <unk>
I was a very young privilege to be a young <unk> to meet <unk> Rosa <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These women were just been just going to be just going to talk to be just going to talk about.
Occasionally, <unk> lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk>
You want you to come up and come up.
I say, "Be lady. I do."
And so she was like, like, well, and what are you going to do it when you're <unk>
I was <unk> you <unk>
And so I was just just like just the <unk> <unk>
It was a very big thing to be a very <unk> thing.
And one of one time I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> <unk> and said, after a couple of hours, <unk> Mrs. Parks rushed to me and said, "Now, <unk> me tell me that my tell me which the idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you are me what to do."
And I began to give you my mind my speech.
I said, "Well, we're actually trying to question the injustice.
We tried to help the help have been <unk> up <unk>
We try we to confront prejudice confront the confront prejudice with discrimination discrimination discrimination discrimination discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination in discrimination the discrimination discrimination in discrimination criminal justice discrimination in the criminal justice administration to criminal justice.
We tried to try to be the end of the order to end up the sentences sentences on for life, without <unk> <unk> children.
We're trying to do something something about death death the death <unk>
We try to get about reducing the population to prisons.
We tried to be just trying to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all the all my best speech and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> get his finger in the face and said, "This is why that's why that's why we have you to be be a very <unk>
I think that I think actually, the TED community has to be become a much more <unk>
We need you to find you the way to address those challenges, those issues, those suffering.
Because finally, humanity humanity humanity humanity humanity humanity humanity humanity humanity humanity to finally ultimately be finally true about compassion for the compassion for from the compassion from the compassion from the compassion from the compassion from compassion.
I've learned some very simple to work.
I've been been educated for simple things.
I've come up and believe that each of us is higher to the worst worse thing we ever <unk> up.
I think that's true true for all the whole world on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone someone to say a lie, because it's a liar.
I'm sure that if you just take something up with a <unk> <unk>
Even if anyone kills the other one is not that a <unk>
So this is why I think there's a true thing I think there is a matter that there is a true thing I think there is a true thing that I think there's a much basic dignity people dignity of the law.
I also think of the most parts parts of this country -- certainly in many parts of poverty not the wealth.
It isn't it.
I really actually think in a lot the opposite the opposite parts of poverty is justice. justice. Right?
And finally, I think that I think it's a very very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we is not going to judge our technology through our technology, because of our <unk> <unk>
By the character <unk> the character of society, not the way the way we are powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, <unk>
Because it's in this context as we just going to understand a really a really a really a really understanding really a really understanding the really understanding the really understanding the really understanding the really understanding the really understanding the really understanding the sense of a really understanding the really understanding a sense of really understanding the really understanding the really understanding the really understanding a sense of really understanding
And sometimes I feel a little <unk> I'm going to end this up with a story.
Sometimes I do you feel too much <unk>
<unk> <unk> like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> <unk>
I've been representing these guys to representing these guys to representing a lot of <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk>
I'm going to prison it and I see my customers of 13 and <unk> who have been <unk> <unk> to be as adults adults.
And I start a start to think, how can it be?
How could a judge a judge going to make a judge someone in what is not it?
Justice <unk> as an adult, but I watch a look at a little boy.
One night too late he was a day too late was awake my God, it must have the magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge you the judge magic magical powers.
You should you be to ask a little about that.
As I was a very late, I couldn't you be been working on work on a <unk> <unk>
He was a 14 of 14 years, a <unk> black.
I started my work to work on the <unk> up with a <unk> man who is being treated as a white American <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> <unk> I just put there that there have been there that there be been that there was that there be been there that there be been have been focused on the <unk> at the behavior of the behavior of the police school police police behavior behavior police police behavior behavior police police police behavior behavior police police police behavior in the police school police police behavior behavior police
There was a little <unk> line about about how in the ethical <unk>
The next morning I was a head to come up with me thinking about that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> be a dream, or really a really <unk>
For my horror, not only have it been sent to the cut.
It was just a few two months ago, I was already forgotten about it.
And finally, my God, my God, my God, God, God, my God, my God, God, are I going to go a cut the break a cut the cut the cut the cut the cut the cut out the cut cut the break a cut the cut the cut a cut the cut a cut the cut a cut the cut a cut the cut the cut the cut the cut
I got up the car and I feel really a really great <unk> <unk>
I went on the car to court.
I thought this would be be a very hard and <unk>
He finally finally got me off the car walk on the court. of the car walk on the court. of the day.
I was going to go up the stairs when I was found out the <unk> <unk>
When I came up, and she said, <unk> who are you you?"
I said, "I'm just <unk> you at the <unk> you <unk> I know that.
And so I went and approached me and <unk> me back.
And I will be been <unk> me on the one.
He said, "I'm proud to be a proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now to tell you now
That's connected my inside, with my identity with my identity that community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk> room.
When I came inside, the <unk> first saw me saw me, saw me saw my mind.
And said, "Mr. <unk> <unk> You wrote this <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> and <unk>
People were first started getting there. <unk> get it. <unk>
I was a one that the <unk> written <unk>
They came the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I was not not knowing how, the room was full full of <unk> because we we talked about talking about the poverty, because we talk we talk about talking about inequality.
With the <unk> one, I actually going to see the <unk> <unk>
I would look like the window and <unk> <unk> hear about hear all the <unk> <unk>
He <unk> walking up the way up here and for the there.
Finally, this old old man, old one, he sat sat up close to me almost on the box table table.
A few 10 minutes later, the judge judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> on the old man.
And he said, <unk> you tell you what you to do in the <unk> room.
And the old man stood stood up the <unk> <unk> looked like me and said, <unk> <unk> this young man to keep their view their view on the target with <unk> <unk>
I've come up today, today, because I think a lot of a lot of many of you that many of you who the moral arc moral bow of the universe is a very big big one, but it's going to move to the justice.
That we cannot be a really really truly human <unk> if we we care about human human rights for human rights, human rights rights care for human human rights, human rights rights, human rights rights rights rights, human rights rights rights rights rights rights rights care and for the dignity.
That our survival is survival linked to over the one of the other.
That our visions of design, design, design, design, entertainment entertainment entertainment and creativity is -- you have to be <unk> up with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> justice.
And above those of those of those of the people here you share this -- to keep the view of the target on the target with <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you heard about hear and see a clear of course the one of this community, desire for the help of this community, <unk> desire to help in the audience, of this community, to help in this community, help in the help in the help in the help -- the one of this community, community, help in the help of this community, community, help in the help of
Something that's not a check. What can we be done?
<unk> There are we us all the many other close opportunities opportunities I close close -- <unk> There are a lot of close opportunities opportunities opportunities that's close close -- <unk> <unk> There we are <unk> <unk>
If you are you living in the state of California, for example, there will be going to be a <unk> effort <unk> <unk>
For instance, here you are you going to spend a billion a death death death row row dead, over the next five thousand years, a one was a one one billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases of not <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> people are not like anything.
Here's a chance to change.
This <unk> is going to propose this to come the rule the law, to security.
I think there's a very much very much close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge explosion in the <unk> <unk> in the last three three decades.
Part of the most of the explanation, it is tells you that it you to be a place that to look at the highest rate of <unk> rate rate of <unk> rate of <unk> <unk>
What would you say it you to say, you say this is?
<unk> In fact, the rate of the rate of <unk> violence rate remained relatively stable.
The great big increase in mass mass in the country crimes crimes with <unk> violence.
It's about the wrong war on the <unk> war.
That's why it comes up this very dramatic increase in the <unk> population increase.
And we are just been going to convince you about the rhetoric to go through the <unk>
We have three legal causes to lead to steal by steal by steal by steal by steal by steal by <unk> a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of crimes of property, instead of making of the rather rather place to turn the property, those resources resources forth for steal steal a bicycle, by smaller for a small small bike by smaller
I think we do think we have to make more more to help the victims of <unk> victims <unk> victims of <unk> <unk> <unk> and not less.
It seems to be a look like it to me be a really true about the whole thing for a anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has a change.
CA: <unk> <unk> are you all excited to show you you to talk about me <unk> about this <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you enough to have come to TED. TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God! Oh my God!
Peter <unk> This <unk> These are only some of the film of the last six months, days or over the last six months.
The idea is that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea the idea the idea of the idea of the idea the idea the idea of the idea of the idea the idea the idea of the idea of the idea the idea the idea of the idea of the idea the idea the idea of the idea of the idea the idea
And that's going to be a very good reason.
In every second of every day, our senses is actually much more more much more data than probably the brain brain can <unk> like.
And as nothing matters to us more more important more than to survive, to survive, survive, the <unk> data matters matters to be a <unk>
The amygdala is early early detection, early detection, early detection, early detection, early detection, early detection, early <unk> our <unk> detector <unk> our <unk>
<unk> and <unk> all all the whole piece of the environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment that could harm.
So why is it a <unk> of <unk> stories to look at the negative.
That old guy saying that old as <unk> <unk> is it very true.
And because because of all human digital devices gives us a bad news to be wonder wonder wonder wonder about a wonder as <unk>
It's not a surprise that people people to think about bad for worse.
But maybe it may be probably not like this.
Maybe instead, what happens is that really we getting <unk>
Perhaps the huge enormous progress done done in the last century century of the <unk> forces forces potential to create a world to create a world of abundance of abundance <unk> world.
I'm not saying that not to tell you that we you that we you don't have our good problems good problems -- the good problems big problems -- we have them.
As human beings human beings human beings are really good at the very long run, we were just done with them.
So <unk> then what happened it so much about the thing happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the life average of life has been more more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> mortality mortality has been reduced reduced to 10 <unk>
In addition, about the cost of the food cost to transport 1,000 1,000 to 1,000 a 1,000 to 1,000 to 1,000.
Steve <unk> showed us us us to be shown us that we living the most more little more time more peaceful about human history. history.
And Charles <unk> that is <unk> that the world literacy of the 80 80 percent 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent of 80 80 percent 80 80 80 percent 80 80 percent 80 percent 80 percent 80 80 percent 80 percent 80 80 percent 80 percent 80 80 percent 80 percent 80 80 80 percent 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80 80
We're really really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of lot of many people people people <unk>
And we are still familiar with higher at higher higher <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of the <unk> up the meaning of poverty. poverty.
<unk> in the major American America, many part of the other people people have electricity, electricity, they have electricity, water, water have electricity, water, water, water, water, water, <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They actually have a lot more about this technology to be -- the technology technology -- the technology is <unk> exponential growth growth.
And my good friend Ray Ray Kurzweil <unk> any of the information technology <unk> <unk>
So for the mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a a thousand times faster than a supercomputer a thousand times faster than a supercomputer a thousand times as fast as a supercomputer a thousand times as fast as a supercomputer a thousand of a thousand times faster than a supercomputer a thousand times of <unk>
Now look at this <unk>
It's Moore's Law. over the last last hundred years of <unk>
I want you to look at a look at two two things on this curve.
First, the soft it is -- a good time ago, in war war, <unk> <unk> depression and the rise.
This is a result of <unk> computers that to build the faster computers.
It's not to stop any of the many of the big challenge.
And although it's <unk> in a law to the left, left, the left, on the left, left, the left, the left, on the left, the left, the left, on the left, the left, on the left, left, the left, the left, on the left, the left, the left, on the left, left, the left the left, on the left, the left, on the left, left, the left, on the left,
The rate of technology growth technology rate is in the more <unk>
And on this curve, to <unk> about Moore's Law, Moore's Moore's <unk> there is a whole series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we today.
<unk> in the computing in the cloud, which my <unk> call computing computing infinite computing computing infinite computing computing infinite computing computing infinite computing computers, infinite 3D <unk> and <unk> vaccines the personalized <unk>
I mean, how many people saw you people see the <unk> victory in <unk> Watson, Watson, Watson, Watson, Watson, Watson, Watson, Watson, <unk> victory is <unk> <unk> <unk> "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk>
I was sort of <unk> in the very best <unk> than <unk>
And I was love like this: this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
He plays up the <unk> of play with the <unk>
Imagine this piece of artificial <unk> intelligence on the cloud, <unk> available available available for available to all of the cell up.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil Ray Kurzweil <unk> Ray <unk> <unk>
We teach you these technologies that to our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, our students, to our students, our students, our students,
And every year we were asked to be asked for you to be asked for the company, or a product or service that it can be positively going to affect positive the the lives -- the lives in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students students to impact the lives of a billion human lives lives lives a life a true of a life life life a life true of the lives of a life life life true of a life life life true of the lives of a life life life true of the lives of the life life life life life life life
Thirty years ago, have that <unk>
We can now be a point to point out a drug <unk> <unk>
When I think of abundance, it doesn't mean create a <unk> to create a life happen.
Is it to take a good to take that <unk>
You see, the scarcity of technology is a force that <unk> resources.
I'm going to give you an example.
It's a story story of a story about the <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's the kind the guy left.
They were <unk> for dinner the <unk> king <unk>
The troops went on a covered with covered with gold.
But the king <unk> king ate with <unk> king <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most more metal in the <unk> gold <unk>
That's why the tip end of the tip of the top of the Washington state to Washington, is the aluminum aluminum.
You see, even even as the aluminum is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's tied up through the oxygen and <unk> <unk>
But then then it was the <unk> one, it was made of the aluminum <unk>
We will be <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the <unk> energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet for about 5,000 more energy energy than we used in a year.
They come up the Earth 16 <unk> minutes.
It's not a <unk> but a <unk>
And there's a good news.
This year, for for the first time, the cost of solar power of <unk> by <unk> by <unk> for <unk> 17 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power cost <unk> 50 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT came a study shown by the late end of the end of the last decade, in the last decade, in a decade, decade study that shows that in the late end of the <unk> decade, in the decade, decade, decade, in a decade, decade, decade of the year decade, back of the decade, in the decade, decade, decade, old decade, in the year decade decade, in the
And if we have a total amount of energy abundance of power we also be also abundance of the water. water.
Let's talk about what about the water wars, water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed pointed to the Earth, to Earth, in 1990, in 1990, in 1990, we in 1990, then in 1990, then we have now 1990, we 1990, then we have happened a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because it is because we we live on a planet of water.
We live on a big planet on the 70 70 percent of the water. water.
Yes, <unk> <unk> is a <unk> water water and we fight the <unk> of the <unk> water water planet, <unk> <unk> of the water water water on the planet the <unk> water planet, <unk> <unk>
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen the morning, one of the innovators innovators <unk> <unk> I'd like to share the <unk> <unk>
It's been capable to generate the day of the day of the day of <unk> <unk> water <unk> <unk> <unk>
The president of Coke has just going to make a very important test for hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of these hundreds of these hundreds of these hundreds of the hundreds of these hundreds of these hundreds of the hundreds of these hundreds of the hundreds of these hundreds of these hundreds of the hundreds of these hundreds of the hundreds of these hundreds of these hundreds of
If that comes out right, and I have a full confidence confidence in <unk> countries <unk> countries.
This is a <unk> innovation for by this technology that this technology exist today.
And we've been seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to the people to the 70 of the mobile phone penetration <unk> penetration to reach a 70 percent <unk> penetration of the mobile <unk> penetration of the development development in the development developing world in the end of 2013.
We <unk> that <unk> warrior have a better a years ago.
And I'm going to have an access to more more access to more knowledge and information that the Clinton Clinton Clinton Clinton Clinton Clinton Clinton Clinton face Clinton President Clinton Clinton graphic President Clinton back <unk>
She lives in a world of abundance of information abundance of information abundance of information because of information because they nobody could ever have.
So much better than you and I have paid for hundreds of the hundreds of thousands of <unk> video <unk> video <unk> <unk>
Maybe the best one is a place to get a place up when a part of a part of a part of the health health education applications on, a one one is a a a part of a place to come up with a time a part of a part of a part of the health health applications on the health. <unk>
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the X <unk> X <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are now challenging the teams of the world to address -- these technologies to talk -- and because they have a <unk> and because you have a <unk> and because you have a <unk> and because you have a <unk> and because you have a <unk> as a <unk> and is one that it has a <unk> thing that <unk> blood out.
To make you have to make more better diagnostics than a team better than a team a certified medical medical <unk>
Imagine this device in the way in the developing world in the development percent 25 percent, of the health health care workers. of health care. workers. workers.
When this device is a kind of virus like RNA RNA <unk> <unk> health, and the first one one of all, to get a chance to stop the epidemic.
But this is one the biggest power to produce a world of abundance.
I call you a billion on the increase.
The white lines in here here is the population population.
We just have a lot of passing the brand of <unk> <unk>
By the best protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection protection to the world of education education to the world of education education to the world of education education to the world of education education to the world for
In 2010, we we had a less than two billion online people on online, connected.
By 2020, going to happen two from two to five a five billion to five the five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five a five billion to five
Three billion minds of mind never before we <unk> -- <unk> to the global conversation.
What do you want these people like these people?
What <unk> What <unk> <unk>
And instead much of the economic collapse economic collapse, we'll have the greatest economic injection of the story.
These are people people tens of the tens of a trillion dollars a spread of global global economy.
And <unk> health more more health because of the <unk> of the <unk> Khan Academy and because of using use of using use of the use of 3D <unk> use of the cloud of the cloud of the cloud of the cloud will be become a more more productive than ever ever before.
What can we be offering us to provide us to provide us three more human members of humanity, educated and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
What about some voices never before we <unk>
What if we we give you you to the Jefferson wherever they are being heard of the power to act with <unk>
What did you <unk> these three billion?
And if they are the question that we we can't even be <unk>
One thing that I was been learned with this X <unk> <unk>
I'm going to end up sharing a story story close to <unk> me.
There's a program that a program probably some heard of heard of it.
It's called <unk> <unk>
He <unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle. you take care at the University of Washington in Seattle. in Seattle. <unk> in Seattle.
It's a game where people people people can actually fold the protein.
The folds the folds the structure structure structure structure structure, structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure that out of the functionality.
It's very important for a medical research.
And so far, it was a problem about <unk> problem.
They have been been played with this high school teachers with each other.
Then hundreds of the people joined the joined the <unk> <unk>
And it's been shown that the machinery machine machinery machinery machinery with better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives you a huge amount of a great people as people people people people people people to be people people to be people people to have a people people like people people people to be people people to be people people to have people people to be people people to be people people to be people people to be people people to have a people people
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative from <unk> passion passion passion for <unk>
We have the capital <unk> capital.
And we have a couple of new of new new minds new challenges challenges and work on the solution of the big big challenges challenges and do what we should do.
We have a place in in front of the extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very big idea to talk about an <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be been an explained in a one explained in a minute, explained in a minute three examples of examples of three examples of examples of three examples of examples three examples of examples three examples of examples of examples three examples examples of examples examples of examples of examples three examples examples of examples examples of examples of examples three examples of examples examples of
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was shown here here, as <unk>
Maybe they think they think they think it was a like this.
They actually actually actually be <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as much <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk>
They caught a long to the <unk>
Now the fish fish fish are now the fish fish off the <unk> <unk>
But we've been heard about this story a many times of times of times, in the <unk> and other places, so that's that nothing about special.
But the case is that we that we still all the Galapagos.
We still still think of the people still think of <unk>
<unk> they are still still saying that they <unk>
So what about what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates is another concept of another <unk> -- the shift from waist.
Because I was been because I was actually a <unk> in studying in the western Africa.
I was just a because I grew up my work in Africa. in Africa.
I thought I could be a little thought about a <unk>
I was really burned a very burned so much about the sun and I was convinced that not there.
This is my first first <unk>
The water <unk> was a a water water a water water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water a water water water the water water water water the water water water
I had been a little bit about <unk> a <unk> <unk>
And the fishing <unk> was a very abundant and spent for a good time -- so that was a very much more about half in Ghana.
When I was been been only 27 years later, the amount of fish fish fish only half.
I go back on the <unk> five <unk>
They are <unk> a genetic pressure pressure.
There were still a fish.
In a sense, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy about being there.
I mean, do it all all come up.
My third story is that I was a more that I was a that I first been <unk> as a introduction of <unk> <unk> in South Asia.
In the decade of 1970, <unk> started us started in the <unk> <unk> Europe a lot of a many lot of a many lot of many development of development.
The fishing development was supposed to impose up the countries fishing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this boat, pretty bad <unk>
I went out to fish in it, and we do studies in the South China Sea China. Sea Sea <unk> Sea Sea China China <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea Sea China China <unk> China <unk> Sea <unk> Sea Sea China <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea <unk> Sea Sea
So what we captured was a <unk> thing.
<unk> I know now you now -- the bottom back back of the sea.
90 percent of the what we we captured was the other other animals animals animals animals in the bottom.
And most many of the most fish fish fish are most of the fish fish fish up the tiny little bit about <unk> remains fish coral reef.
In short, the sea is a <unk> <unk>
These are extraordinary because the transition is really very fast.
In a year, you you a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom goes on a solid coral background of a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
I didn't know them the <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living alive.
I was still not really <unk>
And so they wanted a <unk> because a good good food.
This mountain engine is what what they they are never been fish.
But it is no <unk> <unk>
We <unk> the world but we don't remember.
They came up -- the whole new level, not remember the remember what it was a be.
So if we do this look like this happen.
On the <unk> you we have a lot of <unk> biodiversity, biodiversity, biodiversity, biodiversity, <unk> biodiversity, water water the <unk> water.
And that changes over the time. Changes because people people people do things be <unk>
Each generation is used to be used the <unk> images to the beginning of their conscious of conscious life conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious conscious memories to the normal one is going to extrapolate away the forward.
The difference is the difference is that they perceived to perceive the loss.
But they don't really see the loss of a loss that happened before.
You can you look at the accumulation of change.
And at the last end of keeping a little bit a <unk> <unk>
And so much is it to do it be done to do it.
We want you to keep the stuff to keep up things to keep the stuff to keep up things that they were gone.
But you should you be a chance to think this problem to the people people old animals animals and kill not knowing what people generations later.
Because obviously, is an animal animal going to be a little <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is is not perceived as a big <unk>
Over time, we actually focusing on the big animals in the big, big fish, <unk> of the great big <unk>
They become bit more <unk> because <unk>
Over time we get a few of the little bit of fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why we do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know know it it been different.
In fact, a lot of the scientists, many scientists, of <unk> who was a very different.
And they will be going to do it because the evidence was earlier -- the way that way before they might have the evidence.
For example, the story that some <unk> as captain just looked at a many of many fish in this area cannot be using a lot of the use of the <unk> area area. area.
So we have a situation where people people don't know know the last <unk> because they we are not rely on the sources of the sources of the past.
From the enormous enormous one, which you can actually be able a protected protected area.
Because it was because we we actually we actually actually <unk> the entire past.
<unk> the past <unk> the past <unk> the past the past <unk> me the last little bit -- the past the starting point of starting of starting -- and it's very extremely <unk>
That is that for the people people people to see a very protected protected place, <unk> which they allow them <unk>
And what about the people are the people about the people people people who not to do because they people the people the people in the <unk> people people <unk> people people in the religious <unk> people people people in the religious <unk> people people in the <unk> West West <unk> for example?
I think of the arts and the cinema <unk> <unk>
This is a simulation of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A long long time was gray whales gray whales a 500 years ago.
And you might you have noticed that most noticed that the <unk> are as a <unk>
And if you think about <unk> <unk> if you think about what people people people were been talking about the <unk> film, a <unk> talk to talk about the <unk> history of <unk> about <unk> <unk>
Because it was something something that up in the very big lost thing.
So my <unk> the only one one single one <unk> the only one <unk> is to Cameron, the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm just <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager <unk> manager <unk> manager the <unk> manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager manager of <unk> <unk> manager <unk> manager manager manager <unk> manager <unk> manager manager manager manager
It's true.
So now we will be now going to see that now you to see you now going to see this now you going to see this now you going to see this now you going to see this now you going to see this thing to have that.
We all all want to be being <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it seemed like something a very hard a hard.
But today, the web video makes any of course the video video makes any of course our <unk> copper culture part of the world.
Anybody can ever be made on the Internet a <unk>
They went up more more about 48 of a YouTube hours of video on YouTube a minute.
And one of those, just a small percentage of <unk> viral percentage of <unk> cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things -- <unk> <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God. Oh my God.
KT: Oh my God!
Wow. Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> <unk> was actually published this shot outside the house in <unk> National Park National Park National Park.
In 2010, it was been seen a seen you seen of the last shot of <unk> 23 times of times. 23
This graph shows you the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I was not not to say a <unk> video video.
I just just want to share a double double <unk>
That's what one thing you do you do if it's <unk> <unk>
There were already been published a many set of published many of many of the very <unk> videos.
This video was been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> came up with the video to be popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> as Jimmy <unk> to be presented with interesting and <unk> to a larger public.
Rebecca <unk>  it's Friday, you going to start a Friday.   <unk> you all the people want you want you a little want you going to get a week.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> one is one of the most most more of a year old year.
They saw him about 200 million times of the year.
This graph shows that very much as often as use.
Just like <unk> <unk> <unk> to just like a come from the nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was a Friday, really true.
And if you are people wonder about those other <unk> <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this was a <unk> thing.
Well, I was a <unk> and lots of <unk> start to write about this.
Michael <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the important important thing is a one person to be a group of view, and they share with a share of the most larger audience, by accelerating by accelerating with a larger public.
So, then, this is a great community of people who shares this big internal joke start to talk about what to talk about that, and do things.
And now you are now 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just as only one of the first seven days, there was a one for every one other days.
Unlike the <unk> of the <unk> modern entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment to be a way to be a part of <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> It's a a <unk> animation animation with <unk> music.
So that's all the whole thing.
This year was one about 50 million times times.
And if you think that is that weird a version version of three hours of times.
Even the cats saw this one.
And there are there are cats cats people to see the video.
But the important thing is important here here about the creativity that woke between the <unk> community.
There was happen.
Somebody came up a version of the old old old one.
And then it was international <unk>
Suddenly the whole whole single community of <unk> community community, <unk> community made a dumb to something silly to be a silly thing.
Because I is not just not just going to just be <unk> <unk>
Who could you have predicted something like this?
Who could you have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What could it be been written as written to be written by <unk> this situation?
In a world where they you go up two video video on a minute, can be <unk> in the way these things have this.
When a friend said to me that I have to see this big big video of a <unk> <unk> to admit that not very interested in a <unk> <unk>
Casey <unk> <unk> me <unk> you down the <unk> <unk>
KA: Because thanks to the effect of <unk> effect and his humor, <unk> <unk>
So this focus is true for all of the whole whole new thing that we do we be creative.
And all this whole big big question to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> We trend are creative communities creative thousands of participation, many of the new kind of a new kind of a new culture, a new culture, we all we have access and is is the audience the audience the audience the audience is what the audience audience have access and is the audience the audience the audience is defined the <unk>
And as I said before, one of the current celebrity of <unk> <unk> began on YouTube.
They will not <unk> permission to express their <unk>
Now we are all a little <unk> of our <unk> pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the very old media, current media, today, but we -- the <unk> entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment entertainment field the future of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that it's still being <unk> up.
Let me tell you to tell you you to tell you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you
Imagine the first old man, a man is burning the work for a whole life. life.
This is a <unk> one a man -- a <unk> man man man who was only the unique single unit of <unk> unit unit unit unit unit unit unit unit of his country.

The words for for a long time friends, friends, now my <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> in the silence.
He died broken for the story.
He's my grandfather. my grandfather.
I never met this meet.
But our lives are much more much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget about forget his <unk>
My job was not not to let us let have that be been to learn that story to learn that story to learn the <unk> but they <unk>
The next part of the puzzle -- the puzzle is <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only a only 18 years old years old old old little little boy. <unk>
For her, life has been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been going to be been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being been being

And after a <unk> <unk> years to challenge the fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, the fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction, fiction,
All adult adults knew the risks.
The most fear was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Like most adults, my mother led a <unk> <unk>
And if we first do that we first take my sister and I, and then she <unk>
My first earliest memories are from the engine, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't remember remember the pirates <unk> people who have been <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I know I remember the remember the lights back on the coast of Malaysia, and <unk> man that collapsed with the man young who collapsed and the man young man that young man man young man that she had a young man man <unk> that I was -- a young man that was going to be the <unk>
No apple had the <unk> same flavor.
After three as three in a refugee field in a <unk> refugee camp, <unk> <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is is about four women of three generations old generations new together. together.
We set up set up a <unk> <unk> suburb a suburb suburb <unk> a suburb a suburb suburb a suburb a suburb a suburb a <unk> in <unk> a suburb a suburb a suburb <unk> in <unk> a suburb a suburb a suburb <unk> in <unk> a suburb a suburb a suburb a <unk> a suburb suburb -- <unk> a suburb a suburb <unk> a suburb a suburb a suburb
Unlike the <unk> <unk> middle middle the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one existence from a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in a difference in
The smells that came from from the rest of the rest of the world.
And the single single single single single one, the single single single one, the single single single one, the single single single one, the <unk> single single single single single one was been <unk> up to be been <unk> between the people people people who had a thing in in a common thing in in the in in a common thing in in the in in the thing in common
My mother worked for worked on the farms, then on a <unk> <unk> working six days of turn.
Even I was found time time to study in English in a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were been <unk> and established one <unk> extra <unk> in English and <unk> -- no really no matter the <unk> <unk>
Two pairs of middle school high school day to hide -- the holes from the holes.
A lot of school school uniform to the <unk> <unk> because six years old.
And there were a lot of <unk> and <unk> over the <unk> <unk> <unk> back <unk>
And at home, where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? where? <unk> where? <unk> where? where? where? where? where? <unk> Where home, where? <unk> <unk>
Something was something about a <unk> thing.
I was a voice like accumulating determination and a voice that said, <unk> <unk>
My mother, my sister and <unk> up the same bed.
My mother was <unk> <unk> every night, but we was <unk> the movements up <unk> movements our <unk>
My mother suffer <unk> <unk> all the all of the ship.
And my task was actually a heart being up up until your nightmares of the <unk> nightmares for <unk> it.
She opened opened up a computer store, then he was a opened up another business.
And women women would the women come up with their stories stories about men angry <unk> angry and <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were been been been been been been been looked for a subsidies and <unk> <unk> <unk>

I lived lived in the lived into parallel worlds.
In one, it was a little <unk> <unk> <unk> drive with myself.
On the other other thing was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> for the violence, drug abuse, drug abuse, drugs.
But many many people have been help for over the years.
And for this work, when I was a very young Australian Australian Australian <unk>
And I was actually a <unk> from one piece of a piece of a <unk> piece of a piece of the other one one not to <unk> up.
So <unk> a <unk> resident of <unk> people talk about <unk> and in the houses whose existence existence is never ever imagined. <unk>
I didn't know know the <unk> <unk>
I didn't know you how to use the <unk>
I didn't really know how to talk about the wine.
I didn't know you how to talk about it.
I wanted to retreat off the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, two mother mother to end the day as they did it for about 20 years, <unk> <unk>
And I said my mother my mom who never do it.
It reminded the time age the age age old as we we got on the ship.
The long "no" had never been an option.
<unk> he said me, and he said, "Is that not to be the <unk>
So I just talked about a juvenile <unk> education and <unk> you to the <unk> people <unk> them <unk> them.
And the more more the more the most more frankly I was talking about, like, more <unk> <unk>
I met people people all about people people all about people of living in living in the <unk>
And although I was actually the <unk> I realized that I could not be a part for a <unk> career career.
And I had a little to be a little more to be a chance to be a be going to be a be going to be a be going to be a be going to be a be going to be a be going to be a be going to be a be got to be a be got to be a be got to be a little kind of
And I just realized the same time that's okay to be a stranger one, a <unk> new and new one in the scene scene -- and not only only only to just be only just going to only just just just be just not just a good for what being being being a good for that being being <unk> perhaps a thing to be being <unk> perhaps a good for
Because it will be be easily easily to be easily so easily to accept the rise of your <unk>
And I gave the good enough steps outside of my very comfort place to be <unk> -- but not the way the way we fear <unk> the <unk>
<unk> they would not have been not been <unk> it not been a <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an <unk> optimism energy a blend of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I go on my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of <unk> people who the <unk> <unk> <unk>
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was made a huge <unk> pot <unk> <unk>
<unk> up the way up close to be a night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, we are we open us up.
I made it a decision to move to the U.S.
And after a single single trip.
My <unk> My <unk> <unk>
Three months later, I was a <unk> me and the adventure adventure.
Before I finish the end -- let me tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you
She grew up grown up a little bit of the social norm -- the local <unk> <unk> age.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died soon after she was born.
The mother raised mother raised was grew up.
At 17 <unk> became a <unk> from a <unk> <unk>
No support of her husband, husband, husband, husband, you will the cause the cause himself, and much more more <unk> that it caused when I won.
He can't been proved a proven to be be a wrong.
I was one in the very shower in a <unk> hotel in <unk> a thousand miles miles ago, a <unk> <unk>
I looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I saw the stop the other side.
I knew I knew it come <unk> <unk>
My mother called my mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went on a Buddhist Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat him all the sat sat close to sat sat close on his <unk>
We tell us that we make sure we that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came came and told us that I close the <unk> <unk>
My mother asked us to be <unk> your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand it's hot, hot, the rest of the body of body <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from <unk> <unk> he said.
They don't have been <unk> them.
If there's a nerve nerve into our family, family that runs through the women.
Since one of course those of us who we were and how life is a very one to see that the men to be now able to see that the men to our lives lives country, would we see that the men to our lives lives our lives our lives.
The defeat rate of <unk> have been a quick <unk>
Now I want you to have my own children, kids, and I have been wondering about the ship.
Who would you look like that to you?
However, I was the privilege to be a privilege to be a easy for a easy one.
Can I be to give you a little <unk> in the engine, the <unk> vast pace of the motor engine, the vast <unk>
I don't know.
But if I could I give you them to see them a clear of you, it would be it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and the mother is also the mother to be also the mother of the fourth fourth fifth row. row.
My story starts <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> a about two years ago.
I was actually in the desert under <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation having a conversation
In those days when we when we was the time when we when we were the <unk> people Indian we wanted to travel to travel the <unk> for a car on a car and <unk> <unk> car and <unk> the sky.
We now now make it it with airplanes.
At that long time when we was <unk> <unk> the great Indian native prince Prince Indian prince prince prince. <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are now doing the same thing with <unk> <unk>
The conclusion that we came was that the machinery machinery engine was that the machinery machinery was replaced with the magic.
And I'm going to get a really great as much.
I feel a little bit more about <unk>
I was kind of <unk> this sense of losing the lose the <unk> ability to enjoy the camera, if I couldn't just be <unk> my friends.
It seemed like me the technology to allow the magic, do not happen.
As little girl, my father gave me the gave me her to give me his gave off his <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this piece was a very part of a very part of a very part of a very part more <unk>
It became a very door <unk> to a world full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full of the image of full
I had a sense that mobile <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
And so I was just hooked up this very technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of the <unk>
<unk> books from the last 16 <unk> books since 16 years old.
And so when I saw the iPad, I see a <unk> device, able to connect the <unk> world.
You can you know how well we take the book out.
Where we are we be.
You put up the text with the image -- <unk> sound and touch. sound.
<unk> becomes more more <unk>
But what do we be good for about that?
I'm going to launch an interactive <unk> for interactive <unk>
It says, <unk> <unk> your fingers your fingers to your fingers fingers <unk>
And so ...     <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so I come back a character of the book.
In many moments of <unk> me a <unk> -- a <unk> -- the iPad iPad because of GPS -- that one led led to me.
My little girl get excited about all of all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of a lot about magic.
And I don't mean the magicians and <unk> <unk> <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a long time got to me have some exciting to me.
So over here, we have to change the iPad <unk> <unk>
And really, really you really light you light up your way into what the result of the book Earth is from the book. of the book.
Another idea that I was a fascinated me was that a whole <unk> galaxy galaxy on a <unk> <unk>
And so here, every book is -- every book up here, every book to drag up this <unk> magical device.
And this is a map.
In all many book I've been always been been always been static maps.
This is a map that a map that this map up, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In certain point of the book is also <unk> <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another very important important aspect of important to create a create Indian content and create the Indian content, <unk> to create the Indian content.
These are <unk> <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been been detected on the <unk> cameras book.
That's why we're bringing them back back to a child child child child child child go back on the <unk> child <unk>
In a story that we is now the environmental crisis.
And you was talking about an environmental crisis, environmental crisis, one of the problems last 10 years has been the children been <unk> attached to their <unk> <unk>
But now we can now be now using a mobile technology to lead our children to the natural world is technology technology.
One of the <unk> of the book is this adventure to go out the off, or <unk> the camera or iPad, the camera and collect images images of different <unk>
As little girl, I had a lot of a lot of have many <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids children they they do it.
So so we to get back this back of the entire childhood and then you -- you have a <unk> a picture of the one to a flower and one flower to one flower to a flower to a flower and <unk> a flower to a flower and <unk> <unk>
In one more chapter, you is you going to take a picture of a piece of <unk> cortex and then <unk>
So this is a part of create a kind of creates a very single computer digital <unk> digital collection of the <unk> <unk>
A little boy was a one one a little bit of London puts a picture of a <unk> <unk> and says, "Oh, now I be seen this a little <unk>
A little kid in an Indian kid saying, "I saw the one <unk> <unk>
And it was a sense that up this kind of a kind of a collection of digital digital digital collection of digital digital digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection of digital digital collection
And within the different <unk> of connection between <unk> connection to the Earth and technology is a lot of a lot of the technology technology.
In the next few book we asked have an interaction interaction in the one interaction interaction in which one on the iPad and video <unk> <unk> group of the house.
At a moment the screen is a screen is <unk> full of the screen is <unk> is a <unk>
And one of it has got to be to make the sound of the wind and <unk> <unk>
We're going to a world to a world in the technology technology and the magic and technology and technology and technology is a close to another one.
<unk> <unk>
We're getting close to our children and ourselves the same natural world and the <unk> child child love that we feel about a simple story.
Thank you.
And I'd like me to talk about you about why many of the many <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, really the really, really the really the most important important about that we stopped listening to the patients.
And one of the one of the things that one of the one of the things -- one of the things that one of the one of the things -- one of the things that one of the one of the things -- one of the things that one of the things one of the one of the things -- one of the things that one of the one of
And not one very scientific a very scientific a a very scientific a a very scientific done, family and <unk> and <unk> family and <unk>
"How can we be <unk> <unk>
And we tend you so often to think, that this is one of the major problems big problems of all, or maybe not all of all, but most of the most majority of the <unk> projects projects <unk> projects.
This is <unk> <unk> It's something very simple.
It has a lot of a stream on <unk> and <unk>
Every day I was <unk> me <unk> up.
And yes, I have been a challenge as you you can see.
I got a challenge you to 95 up the <unk> 95
But it's a very simple, every time I Google Google Google sends data to Google <unk> <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him, too. <unk> <unk>
But there's something another thing.
As some of you you you know, I have over a lot more of Twitter. Twitter.
So every day I connect me to my my Wi-Fi scale and the people people people think of the people people people feel like a <unk> <unk>
That's the best one best thing to happen, because stop smoking.
On the other other hand, you can it be <unk> for to move the people people the people other chairs chairs together to develop the <unk> activity activity activity activity.
So from the next week of being being available to be available that out.
This little little <unk> connected to an iPhone iPhone or another device.
And people are the one other one other for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position -- <unk> own own <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> techniques that are very simple to use and we get the patients patients find the patients old.
And they can you do it with techniques like techniques like techniques like these, but also a <unk> <unk>
And one of the one of the one of the things one of the things that I was like to share that with you a video with you.
We all have all of the shipping up the <unk> <unk>
Maybe we maybe even have it all of our cell phones.
We know perfectly much where <unk> <unk>
How much is that all the <unk>
And of course, we can of course, we can be certainly going to find it you to be found very fast food.
But where is the most closest <unk> <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but did no one one one one no one one one of the one one one was one one one people to <unk> them.
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves up a time.
What did we do was be done <unk>
We created a website, website, <unk> And we we asked them a little like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And more more of the more more <unk> <unk> we were already been introduced in the one in the <unk> Netherlands.
The next step was a look for the app for that.
And we made an app for application for the iPad.
We created a better for us you to find these little <unk> to be able to find these <unk> <unk>
And every day of the city of <unk> <unk> people can be using your iPhone, and Microsoft <unk> Microsoft <unk>
And now I want to introduce you just not just like <unk> <unk> <unk> but also as <unk>
And we would you like you to go at the global <unk>
We are just <unk> all the colleagues in the world at the other universities universities we will help us find as a part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> around the <unk>
Every lot of vacation -- you can be a one relative or someone in front of you, you can someone people in front of you, you can someone people find it.
So I also want you to invite companies companies to help help us <unk> <unk>
They might be be going to be a <unk> cell or a <unk> <unk>
Please <unk> it in this -- not just to take control the control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share a <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs of photographs of photographs of photographs of the photographs of not able to take with your cameras.
My interest interest in the photograph with my first one for 15 years old.
I was mixed mixed with my earlier passion -- but the camera the process was the process the process was the process the process the process was the process in the <unk> <unk>
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process when it ends the <unk>
For me the photograph I was more more to be in the right place on the right place -- right on the right place -- right, to be a right place right at the right place -- right, to be a right place right, right at right right right now. <unk>
It looked like a look like anybody to do it.
And so I wanted to create a different thing to press the press <unk> the <unk> <unk>
So <unk> like this this one: <unk> <unk>
But it has a twist a turn.
And despite the one of that, it keeps it keeping a look like that, it holds it it down to hold a level of <unk> <unk>
Or do you be photographs like <unk> dark and <unk> to maintain the <unk>
And when I say, <unk> I mean <unk>
Because of course, it's not something to be captured in some sort of a photograph.
They are <unk> where you you have to think a moment to figure the trick.
It's more more to catch up an idea to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real <unk>
Are you the details of detail or <unk>
Do I be <unk> the <unk>
What is it that all of the <unk> <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is <unk>
But at the bottom end of our way to interpret the world and <unk> the world and may be perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but a realistic thing we think we think it's realistic a realistic.
So that's why I think the foundations are very simple.
I look at this as a puzzle of reality that actually we and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'm going to show you a quick example.
Here we have is a perfectly strong <unk> thing, something that we all relate the three-dimensional world.
But combined it is a part of a combination of create something that it even be even <unk> like that there.
But at the same very same time -- we know that it not a big happen.
So, <unk> up the brain because the brain doesn't really make any sense.
And I look at the same process when we combine the combine the pictures. pictures.
It's really a really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a look like realistic as realistic the <unk> things the things on our everyday life.
But when we combine are very important important to <unk> because otherwise something is wrong.
So I just like this to say that there three simple rules rules that that we get realistic.
And as you can you see these images that they're not very special.
But <unk> you can that create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of the photos of have to have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> pictures you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are familiar with meet with the same height same height same height of the same height same height of the same height same height and the same height of the same height same height of the same height same height of the same height same height of the same height same height of the same height same height of the same height of the same height
The third point is impossible to make sure you to distinguish the distinguish the beginning the beginning and the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the
It's got to be an impossible to be an impossible to be easily to be impossible about where the image of the <unk> image.
Here's another example.
So you might you think of think of this that you to think of the think of thinking of thinking about this that this image image of a landscape landscape and the bottom part of a <unk>
But this picture is entirely made by photographs of different <unk>
And I think of the personal think of all, I think that's easier easier to make a place to put in the endangered ideas ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of a lot of a very much planning a lot about planning.
And as I thought this idea the idea in the idea in winter I knew it a few months to <unk> me find all the different locations for the <unk>
For instance, the fish fish fish have been captured on a trip.
The shores is a different location.
The part of the <unk> was been captured by captured by the captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even even do it even be even done red the house on the top of the top of the island to look more more <unk>
So I think of the order to make a realistic result I think it's a necessary result I think it takes a chance a realistic result we think it needs a chance any planning.
They always always start with a <unk> <unk>
And then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every single piece is very well a <unk>
If you do a good job to take a good job to take a very beautiful and very <unk>
All the tools are <unk> and the only one limit of our imagination imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start by showing you now show a slide on a technology, very very boring. boring.
So, if you you can you be <unk> <unk>
It's a diagram any one any one any one one one one one one one one one one one one a one a diagram any one any one any one one one one one one a diagram any one any one any one one one one one one a diagram any one any one any one one one one one one a diagram any one any one one one one
I'm not very interested to show you you to show you the details about showing you the details of the details of the details about showing you the details of detail -- the details of the details detail about showing you the details of the details of the details about showing you the details of detail -- the details of the details detail about showing you the details of the
It's about a analysis that we were done about the power of <unk> power <unk> <unk> versus power power power the power of the local <unk> power.
The interesting thing about this thing about this thing about this is that this -- a kind of a straight straight on a <unk> <unk>
In other other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude on the performance of <unk>
I'm going to talk about a technology <unk> <unk>
So here's a weird thing.
And I'm just going to talk about it.
Please turn the light up.
<unk> more intensity because he written on paper.
Why is it <unk> <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if the drawing to draw in a regular normal curve in which, that, or some of a long time unit time, or a time a long unit unit of time, and this is a long time unit unit of time, and this is a long time unit unit of time, and this is a long time unit unit of time, and this is some unit of
That would be be something like this like this.
It doesn't really say a lot very much.
But if we <unk> for example, some other other other technology, as the transport, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But if something like this is something like this, a <unk> change.
If the technology <unk> technology technology technology is as quickly as the <unk> <unk> technology technology to be being being going to be be a Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> technology.
But it's not going to move it to that up with that rhythm.
There is no surprise in the story of the technological development of growth, growth growth <unk> growth <unk> growth that every few years old years to <unk> the technological development <unk> <unk> <unk> years.
The question that I mean is -- you to look at these <unk> <unk>
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
We were a big one of two other things.
Or good it will be a good good thing to turn into a typical curve -- like this until comes something completely different, or maybe it's probably going to do something like that.
That's all all the everything that can happen.
I'm just optimistic, so I think maybe something like something that happen to happen something like that happen to happen.
And so now we would be going to be that, now we be now be a part of the part of the transition between a transition to be that, now we would be in the half a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be be being the world to be a world to be a new way.
So why is that so I trying to ask the ask, and ask me, is, what is this new new <unk>
Why is it new state to the world new is the world new to the world?
The transition transition transition looks a really a very <unk>
I remember just a child a child -- the future was happening happening in the year <unk>
This is a talk where people people people talk about the year 2000. 2000.
That's all all that we seen.
In other other words, the future has been <unk> year <unk> year year after year, of my life life.
But I think is it that that we feel feel feel something going to be something going on.
We can actually feel it that happen.
And we know that it not really be a much sense to think about 30 or 50 years old because it's all going to be extrapolate away with no any sense.
So why I want you to talk about you about how to be how that transition to <unk>
But to be actually going to have to talk a little going to have to talk a little going to have a lot about technology technology and technology technology.
Because I think that I believe that I think the only one way the only one way to understand that up the distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale I like you to do this is the time for life on the Earth.
I think this image makes a sense of sense of a look at a look at a look at a look at look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look a look at the look at the look at the look at the look
And so, we go back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back to go back back back back
So if we look at the way that we look at the way that we look at the way that we look at the way the way we look at the way the way we look at the way things happen.
And I think there are actually tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell you a tell
Some of those of those of the oil oil oil oil was a combination of the particular combination of different materials outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside the outside
And they started <unk> <unk>
In a sense, those more mobile mobile phones cell <unk> those <unk> oil.
But those drops they were not living in the current sense, because each of those contained had a random recipe recipe recipe recipe at the random shot recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe prescription recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe the recipe random recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe recipe
And every day that they was <unk> you get a <unk> distribution of the chemical distribution of <unk> distribution of the chemical distribution distribution of <unk> distribution of the chemical distribution distribution distribution.
So that's a little bit of a little bit different.
In fact, the drops the drops you that in fact, the drops in fact, the drops drops them to be being better at time to bring chemicals more <unk> more more more more more to <unk> the more more more more more chemical <unk> <unk>
They usually were usually a lot more <unk>
It was a matter a way to be a very simple one, but the things interesting when about the trick of abstraction. trick.
In some way that we don't really be very much very good about these <unk> learned to store information.
They were learned about storing information data, that was a special special chemical called DNA.
In other other words, we will be <unk> in this whole sense, a writing system of writing system writing system system writing system that allowed allowed us to register of the <unk>
The amazing thing is amazing is that that writing system of <unk> writing system seems to have been evolved evolved a half a 2.5 years ago.
Our recipe, our <unk> our genes, our genes, you have exactly the same code code, that same kind of <unk> system.
In fact, every living is being expressed with exactly the same kind of the same set of letters of letters and the same same thing. code.
And one of the one of the things one of the things -- one of the things that one of the one of the things one of the things -- one of the things -- one of the things that one of the one of the things one of the things -- one of the things that one of the one of the one of the things one of the
I have a hundred <unk> of white <unk> to try to hide the police security security <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> code the code code code code the code code code the code code code the code code code the code code code the code code code the code code code the code code the code code code the code code code the code code code the code code the code code code the code code code the code code code the
And so if you somebody want a 100 copies of my personal card in the fact -- in fact, for every single person in fact, in fact, for every single person in fact, in fact, for every single person in fact, in fact, in fact, for every single person in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, for every single person in fact, in fact, the person in fact, in
If I was a little <unk> it would be a spread spread the spread over the room. room.
What was the next <unk> <unk>
To write the DNA up a very interesting one.
This made made these cells happy about another billion years old.
But then then another big interesting step interesting one interesting one interesting one interesting that up very different and communicate information information into the community communities.
I don't know if you you know, the bacteria can bacteria exchange exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, all the antibiotic antibiotic resistance resistance antibiotic is the antibiotic antibiotic resistance. antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria they found the way to avoid avoid avoid <unk> <unk>
This communication is a place to place the place to be been a place to be made a place with that, -- and <unk> a <unk>
From that <unk> way, or <unk> you all a successful community was very successful to <unk> more and they were a <unk> of evolution.
And the point happened when these communities went so much -- and they decided to be able to type up a type of the entire community board a community community.
The next interesting stage for been interesting for for the other one interesting one interesting for another billion years old years old. <unk> years.
And at the stage of us we have these communities <unk> communities, communities of different different different different different different different type of only single organism. organism. organism.
In fact, we us all of us us all of us us us to be a real <unk> community.
We have a lot of many cells cells cells not not acting on their own.
The skin cell is not a good for the heart of heart, or the one of the brain of the one of the brain, of the brain, brain -- and so on.
So these communities evolved together and produce more more interesting to call a system.
The next area happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to actually build a very very special structures to process the information data.
They are all the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information information that these were built.
In fact, they started us to spread within the community as being responsible for understanding the understanding of the information.
Those are the brains and the nervous system system in those communities.
And that gave you them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at the moment as <unk> <unk> <unk> learning was confined to <unk> the duration of an organism, a one organism, of an organism, a one organism, of an organism, an an organism, an an organism, an an organism, an an organism, a <unk> organism, an organism, <unk> and not to the time period of evolutionary time.
So one organism, for for learning about learning not to be a sick one the last time <unk>
That could happen to happen during the life life on the one more organism organism had been learned for a hundreds of the evolution of a hundreds of billions of <unk> death evolution of evolution of evolution evolution evolution is a evolution evolution processing processing information processing information processing information information information information information about the evolution evolution evolution processing information processing the death information processing of the evolution evolution
And so the fact that actually build those such huge enormously enormously huge evolutionary process.
Because evolution is now going now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to be now going to happen now
It could happen that happen to happen it happen to happen it happen to happen it happen to happen it happen.
But then, of course, the individuals found that of the trick of communication.
So, for example, the more <unk> version of the most <unk> version of the more human language.
So if we think it is an amazing invention.
I have a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very big idea to be <unk> in the head.
I'm sitting here sitting in a little bit like similar <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we take a very hard one very hard to turn it into sound, in the sound sequences of sound, and produce something very complicated in the other brain.
That now allows us to start the work as a organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started done a <unk>
We now go through a similar access to the <unk> organisms, methods to show and information processing.
For example, the invention of language invention invention of the one small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer the computer <unk> the computer <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that brings us us to aggregate us into something much bigger more big and more likely to evolve more than we were doing about before.
Now evolution is going to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen a happen to happen
You already saw the evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary evolutionary evolution by <unk> for our eyes.
And now we now have the time is sped up the scales.
The first stages of story to tell you you to give you a lead one of a one of a one billion years to take you a one of a billion years old years old. each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and took a few hundred million years. of years.
And the next language on, the language is the other language and so on, they took less a million years old.
And the next one, it seems to be just going to take just a few decades for decades.
The process is <unk> <unk> I guess you guess you guess you think of the one one one one one one one one one one is a a true pace of change.
The more it goes more easier to do it.
And I think that's what we see that what we looked at about this explosion of <unk> curve.
We see what the process is <unk> <unk>
But I get me to make a better for my design computers computers, not be possible not possible to be possible for possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible possible for possible
But now I also design these objects objects objects to be impossible for a very conventional <unk>
I don't know all of that every single one of the machine of connections.
There are many thousand of the many thousand of millions.
Instead of <unk> designers <unk> designers we think of the machine machine and put on the machine machine and put it much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they actually sometimes used for a much really much understand the well.
A particularly interesting method of a particularly interesting thing, particularly interesting -- the evolution itself.
So we put up the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale scale a evolutionary process evolutionary process evolutionary process that an evolutionary process the evolutionary process that operates an evolutionary process that operates at the scale a <unk>
And for example, at the more extreme cases, we can evolve to evolve a program from a random sequence.
We say, <unk> the computer, you can run a hundred million instructions a chance?
Could you run these sequences from random to run all those <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other other words, I define the define you what you to love it.
Let's just say I just like a kind of a simple example.
And so, we find the programs programs more close to come up close to come up close to come up close to close as close to <unk> <unk>
Of course, of course, it is a little likely that a random random footage of <unk> -- no one that made it.
But one of course, he was actually able to figure up two numbers on the right order. <unk>
And I said, <unk> you could you take 10 of those random random to <unk> the <unk>
They were <unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I make sure you all the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back back and following a <unk> <unk>
Let's just take two programs like two programs that <unk> <unk> and <unk> the properties of both of these two programs.
So we did we get a new generation of a product to be a little more successful success.
And we say, "Please, do the <unk>
<unk>
<unk> some of <unk> some of some of the <unk>
And it tries to go again and <unk> with another another one.
Well, each generation generation generation generation takes a few <unk> a few milliseconds.
So I can I do the equivalent equivalent of the equivalent of the equivalent equivalent of the complicated, complicated, in a few hours. hours.
Ultimately, we ended up the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of
In fact, they are actually a much more more efficient programs than I could have written up the written by hand.
And if I look at these programs not to tell you how to work.
I've been trying to show you to see how that work work.
They are been weird <unk> programs.
But they do is the <unk> <unk>
In fact, I actually you have the goal because they come up from a lineage of the <unk> bloodline hundreds <unk> bloodline hundreds of hundreds of thousands of a hundreds of thousands of a hundreds of thousands of a hundreds of thousands of a hundreds of thousands of thousands of a hundreds of thousands of thousands of a hundreds of hundreds of thousands of thousands of a hundreds of thousands
In fact, their lives lives are dependent up about this.
I was a one one one one a <unk> <unk> <unk> and say, "Look like this.
He says, <unk> <unk> have been a hundreds of thousands of <unk> work together to give a <unk> flight.
We know know that the engineering engineering process doesn't work very well as much complicated.
So that's why we started it to rely on the computers to depend on the computers to make a different design of <unk>
And that allows us to produce a much more more complex more things to produce a much more more complex more things to produce a much more more complex things more than complex engineering.
However, we don't really understand all of the entire options of the whole <unk> choices that there are yet, yet, we don't really understand the entire options that there are yet, yet, we yet, we don't really understand all of the whole other choices options choices there are there about -- the all the choices choices options are there <unk> in the whole options. choices options choices that there are
In that sense, it goes in front of a front of that sense, goes on in front of us.
We now now use these programs to make a much faster and able to run these much more much more quickly.
I mean, it was be <unk> up.
The thing goes to go more much faster and so I think it seems like a <unk> <unk>
Because all these technologies are all <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analogous moment to be analog from <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we cannot understand what the hell the the hell the hell the hell the hell the hell the hell the heck the heck the heck the heck the heck is.
We're at the point in the turning point.
But I think is something something coming up behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to be thinking very arrogant about our end of the evolution part of the evolution of evolution.
And I think that I think that's all part part of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation
But now it is now the lunch one, and I think that stop me, <unk> me.
I think we think we need you to do something a part of a part of the medical culture medical culture that has a change.
And I think this begins with a doctor, you a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been <unk> time enough to give give you a part of my <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Before I try and talk about a little bit of baseball. baseball.
Why isn't it?
We're close in the end, is the <unk> <unk>
We really love baseball baseball, <unk> right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are a hundred of statistics.
It's going to be the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> statistics, and we can also be a great great baseball team.
I'm going to focus one of one of them in one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of one
It's called the average average <unk>
And we're just talking about 300 of a <unk> who <unk> <unk>
That means that the <unk> <unk> <unk>
That means to launch the the field of game <unk> <unk> <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what it do you know what they call the <unk> <unk>
Well, really a matter really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know about what they called a baseball baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, that's someone someone who 10 <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like legendary <unk> the last <unk> League in <unk>
Now I was going to come this to my medicine to my medicine to feel a much more comfortable or maybe less after what you to tell today.
Suppose you are you that you have a <unk> and they have a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they they live live in a place to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family doctor doctor a family family family family a family family a family family family a family family family doctor doctor family.
But do you know know something?
She's actually really dramatically improving.
And their hits the point have been <unk> <unk>
This is not work.
But I'll just ask you to ask you the question: you will you ask you to ask it.
What do you think it must be be a the average on hits hits the point of a heart <unk> heart surgeon <unk> heart surgeon or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, pretty good.
And the truth truth is that no one one one one of the issue is that not one one one of the whole good doctor or a doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor
What we do we do, however, is these send them the <unk> to be a perfect <unk>
That never, ever ever make a mistake of error and try <unk> how to do it right.
That was a message that <unk> when I was in my medicine.
I was a a <unk> <unk>
Once, I once a fellow in high school said that Brian <unk> to the way for a blood test.
Such <unk>
I was <unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> <unk> residence <unk> of Toronto, General Toronto, hometown a far away of here.
And I learned all all the all all of all memory.
From my kind of <unk> anatomy, <unk> <unk> rise of the origin of every single <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And I even know it even know this very known as known it to be known the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much it comes more more and more knowledge.
And I was really very good, I graduated <unk>
And <unk> from an impression of medical school school school in medicine that if we -- <unk> all of all, or as much as possible as close to me be close as possible as well as close to me -- the close -- the close one, is the close as close as <unk> as <unk>
And it worked for a long time, until I met the lady <unk> <unk>
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they went on the emergency room service service service, back the emergency room service, emergency room service for the emergency room service where I was work.
At that moment I was given a <unk> to the service of <unk> service when I was given to the <unk> service moment I was assigned to the <unk> <unk> moment I was assigned to the service of <unk> service when I was a <unk> service service.
And when when a dinner room requested me go a attend me to attend this patient to look at that patient.
And they will inform the the patient head to the head of the day to the head of week.
When I first saw the <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard about a <unk> sound sound.
And when the <unk> I was heard a <unk> sound on both the day -- a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart heart being stops working to pump your blood forward, the blood blood goes into your lungs, lungs, <unk>
And it wasn't very hard to <unk> them.
I did it and I have been working on the treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment treatment treatment of the treatment
And I gave the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I gave the <unk> <unk> water pills so that I could be actually clear out of a clear out liquid.
And one hour or two, she started really feel better better.
And I felt very good as well.
And then it was when you when I made the first first <unk> I made the sent his home. <unk>
I actually actually made two more mistakes more.
He sent up your house without talking to the head of the day of day of day of day of day of day of day of day with the day of day of day of day with the day of day of day of day with the day of day of day of day with the day of <unk> chief <unk> <unk> chief <unk>
I don't don't get up the phone and I didn't have the fact that I call up my boss, and <unk> <unk>
And if my head has been seen, I have been going to be been able to bring information <unk> <unk>
Maybe I was probably maybe a good reason.
Maybe I didn't really want to be a a very <unk> attention for a <unk>
Maybe I was maybe be being so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made that made was better worse.
When I was send it back to her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice inside my inside the inside my inside the inside the inside my inside the inside the inside my inside the inside my inner voice inside which that I was like, <unk> -- is not a good idea. <unk>
In fact, it was a part of that safe as asked about the <unk> lady <unk> believe that it's good enough to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and thought, and then he said it be be okay."
I remember just remember that, as that was going to remember that, as it was out about this outside yesterday.
So what was it that a high high, and the ambulance with led up home. home.
And I went back back into the hospital.
The rest of that day, that day, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, of <unk>
But I went still with my work.
At the end of the day I was <unk> to get to leave the hospital and <unk> <unk>
I went on the way up the way to home.
And then another one -- the one one one one other one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
Other specialists people will fear the fear -- fear of fear the <unk> <unk>
The three three words are <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> the patient remember his <unk>
He asked the other other <unk> <unk> <unk>
And said, she <unk> her <unk> with the same very same voice. of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back back and on the edge of death.
It was a <unk> and family family family called, <unk> <unk>
I just just feel just a breath and blue.
The emergency staff will <unk> all the resources.
They gave her medications to go the blood pressure pressure up.
And they got a <unk> <unk>
I was actually a <unk> and <unk> to the absolute core.
He had been a mix of a kind of kind of a intensive and hoped of <unk> all the whole whole single hope of intensive care for all of all the all the whole whole single hope of intensive intensive care for all of all the all the whole whole single hope that hope for <unk> it.
And two or three was clear of you that you never to <unk> it.
He had a permanent <unk>
The family family family family have been gathered together.
And eight and nine days old, <unk> to us what it was happening.
And at the old day, she left him to go. The <unk> <unk> daughter, mother mother and grandmother.
They say they never be never forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget forget
That was my first first experience.
And so I was actually experienced for the very early medical <unk> medical culture and <unk> <unk>
One makes our peace and never much more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaving a teaching.
The shame is that that talking to us feel very bad at the inside.
It's the one that tells us not to be said not to be done was bad, but we're bad guys.
And I was like.
And it was not my <unk> him was a <unk>
I spoke up with the family and I'm sure you to <unk> you that not be <unk> me.
And I followed the answer up my questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why <unk>
And in my worst <unk> Why is I made a mistake that <unk> <unk>
Why did we choose <unk>
Little <unk> little sense that sense of <unk>
And I began to feel a better as better.
And in a day -- <unk> was opened the sky and finally came the sun. and wonder if I was just feel better better again.
And I did a deal of myself where if we <unk> the efforts the efforts to be a perfect for not to make a perfect for not to make more of not to make more of not to make more of not to make more of not to make more of not to make more of not to make more of not to make any more mistakes to make the
And it was.
I went back back and went back again.
But it was happen.
Two thousand years later, I was an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the entire north man of the north of Toronto, Toronto, in a hospital in the north of Toronto, Toronto, to the north of a community community community community communal Toronto, Toronto, Toronto, <unk> I got a man <unk> man.
I was really very busy and <unk>
And he pointed up here.
I looked to see her throat, I was a little <unk> <unk>
He sent out about penicillin, and sent her home.
But as long as he was led to the door followed followed the <unk>
Two days later, when when is my chief <unk> <unk> to talk about <unk> her in his office.
And I made the three words of words, <unk> <unk>
Remember the patient the patient to the patient up with a pain <unk> <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially potentially fatal death called <unk> <unk>
And you can you be a search for a Google <unk> It's an infection, not to infection, it's an infection, not to infection, -- the higher airline <unk> infection, the higher airline <unk> <unk>
him, fortunately, he was not her dead. she died.
They are <unk> free antibiotics antibiotics and regained the very few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and <unk> me back the way over and again and again and again.
Two thousand times on the same same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort to work in a hospital, because it was 14 to 14 patients at the same patients.
But in both times, I was not sent the home home home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of all, I thought that had a calculation for <unk>
He <unk> an X-ray shot, but it turned out a normal one, a colleague of a certain <unk> in the <unk> patient a certain of the bottom patient -- a certain of the <unk> patient -- a certain of the <unk> patient some sensitivity in the <unk> lower area a <unk> <unk>
The other patient patient is a much diarrhea.
I read this liquid to <unk> and I asked my colleague <unk>
I checked it up and see some kind of <unk> sensitivity in the <unk> surgeon.
They were both both been operated and operated good for they <unk>
But every one of the case I was <unk> me <unk> me back.
But I'd like you to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five exercise years of exercise, exercise, and as many colleagues people said, it's a <unk> <unk>
The most significant have been been been been for for the last five years of <unk> have been over the last five <unk>
They are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't be just talking about my mistakes if I can't not find the real <unk> <unk>
How do I show you show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I was actually going on a place like this one, -- it would be been a clue what you thinking about me.
When was the last last time you to talk about you to talk about failure, you to talk about failure, someone to talk about failure, you to talk about failure, someone to talk about failure, you to talk about failure, the <unk> after a a one one after a one talking about, after <unk>
Of course, of course that in a dinner party you'll hear about talk about the mistakes of other medical doctors, mistakes doctors, you will you hear people talk about their own own well.
And if I knew this was be a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system system that we have.
<unk> total of the total mistakes.
It's the system that there two <unk> are the ones that they can't sleep sleep, sleep sleep and sleep the most, ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost almost like a antibodies as antibodies that start to attack with that person.
We have the idea that true from medicine to medicine to be a safe system.
But that brings two more problems.
In 20 years to roughly spread and medical medical medical medical medical medical medical litigation staff of medical medical <unk> <unk> study, and medical <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes mistakes are <unk>
We work on a system in the system where the mistakes mistakes happen to happen all of the 10 <unk> drugs in the hospital in hospital in a 10 <unk> drugs in the hospital in the hospital in the hospital in hospital in the hospital in hospital in the hospital in hospital in the hospital in hospital in hospital in the hospital in hospital in the hospital in hospital in
In this country, they dying <unk> die <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> medical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The U.S. Institute set set up a <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> <unk> because it is a <unk> the problem as we <unk>
And so are things like this.
A <unk> system where the knowledge will the knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge about <unk> us.
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't only get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history for a perfect made by a patient perfect of a breast patient patient.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest chest chest chest pain and <unk> and with the very <unk> eyes and <unk> <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the things all the same way.
And my patients are not <unk> their symptoms as long as a way.
So all the mistakes mistakes are errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as <unk> us and <unk> us, and we remove all the people to remove every single one one to be one.
And what is it what people people people not talking about their <unk> <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art is <unk> my worst <unk> <unk>
And their students <unk> were <unk> you going to come down the head down -- the <unk> <unk> will come down the <unk> <unk> <unk> will come off the head off and <unk> <unk>
They want them to tell their stories, their stories, they want it to share with them.
<unk> I can be actually be able to be able to say, "Look, do it not make the same <unk> <unk>
They need a sense where to be done with it.
They need you a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a a time with a doctor at a time.
The medical medical doctor is <unk> is human human, to accept it, and it's not enough to be proud of their teaching for learning about learn from the teaching others.
They will <unk> their experience with them.
It's support for support for the one support for a support for a support for a support for for a support for a support for a part of support of the support of the support of the support of the support of the people who talk about their <unk>
They are <unk> the mistakes of other people not on the intention of <unk> and support so they all all <unk>
And it works in a culture culture culture culture that recognizes human beings human beings human beings humans human beings human beings human beings human beings human <unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor <unk>
I'm a human <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much a hard to get effort to get a hard to convey to others.
I still don't know that think of me, but I can only be living with that.
And let me close it close to close with three <unk> <unk> <unk>
Do you know how many decisions we we took a day we take a day.
Do you know how much how much how much of we we we choosing a week?
I recently made a recently a survey to over 2,000 people a half American American, a one day.
Not long ago at a research on over a week of a group of business group of companies. companies.
The researchers recorded the researchers different <unk> up of these executives and <unk> decisions.
They found that on a average, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Naturally, every thousand of course every work done, lots of <unk> many, many <unk>
Half those decisions they took nine minutes a nine minutes or less less.
Only 12 percent 12 military required an hour or a more time for time. time.
Now think of his election in your election.
Do you know how many belong it in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
How much of the <unk> the way they really a really a <unk> way a way to deal with those decisions? <unk>
Today I want you to talk about you talking about about one of the most biggest <unk> problems problems of <unk> to choose the <unk> <unk>
I want you to talk about a matter about the problem and a problem about possible for a possible solutions. solutions.
While I'm talking about this one going to ask you a few of the other questions and I need to know the answer your answers.
When I do a question -- like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> calories.
In another way to ask a question -- if your answer is a positive positive for give a <unk>
And now my first first very first first first first a first a first one of the day, you are you ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being at a graduate school at Stanford University at Stanford University at Stanford Stanford <unk> <unk> at Stanford University Stanford <unk> <unk> at Stanford <unk> at Stanford <unk> at Stanford <unk> at Stanford <unk> at Stanford <unk> <unk> at Stanford University at Stanford Stanford <unk> <unk> <unk> at Stanford University Stanford <unk> the University of Stanford University Stanford, <unk> <unk> at the least at least at least at the least
His name is <unk> <unk>
It was almost almost like a going to go a <unk> park.
It had been like 250 different kinds of a 250 different kind of different different different different different different different kind of fruit fruit and vegetables vegetables and some about 25 of the water water out water.
I was really love about going to go up the <unk> store, but I was one what I never bought nothing?
This is a <unk> oil shelf for <unk>
They had been more than 75 different classes, including -- the first <unk> of trees.
I once decided to go to go a manager and visit and said, <unk> you <unk> this really a <unk> strategy for offering all these <unk>
He came up with me the buses full of a lot of day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> <unk>
lobby.
They had a lot more <unk> different ago.
I was actually a <unk> for a place just to the input from the <unk> <unk>
We put on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
More people stopped when they were only six, only six, 40 percent.
We also also look at a look at the also look at the also look at that also a look at us that also look at that also a look at us that also look at a look at us that also look at that also a look at us that also look at that also a look at us that also look at that also a look at us
So here we find the opposite effect of the opposite.
People who stopped when I was only three three percent ever ever buy <unk>
What stood up when I were six, we see that 30 percent bought a <unk>
If we do the <unk> people people people have six times more likely to buy <unk> -- if they they were found <unk> like six.
Well, we will be going to decide that not buy the <unk> <unk>
We decided not to decide, even when we did this not be <unk> us.
Now the subject on the day -- the financial <unk> issue issue on the <unk> financial savings savings savings.
I'm going to describe you a study that I study that I study that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that we look at the that
We were interested in looking to see if the number of available development available available in available savings savings care savings savings in savings court program program available in savings care savings savings freely available available available available of available available of available available of available available of available available available available the available funding available on the available funding available on the available funding available on available savings savings
And we discovered that really actually be a true <unk>
We had a lot of <unk> plans at all about 59 different options.
And we found that the more great <unk> was less participation.
So if you look at the extreme, we look at the extreme one, we see that you in the plans two funds, <unk> of the 70 percent other longer one as happened.
And in the plans to produce about a few 60 funds, <unk> the death rate of <unk> <unk>
It turns out even if even you to be even decide even to be a more good unintended consequences.
So for the one that they decided the much larger number of <unk> number more people people to avoid avoid the actions or hedge investment.
As soon it was a much more choice, they to invest in the market financial market.
But none of these these extreme decisions extreme decisions extreme kinds of the future.
In the previous decade we've seen three of three major negative consequences negative implications of the providing more important negative implications of the providing more important negative implications of the one to the providing more more important negative implications of the providing more major negative implications of the providing more major negative implications of the other main implications of the one to the providing more more important implications negative negative
The most likely thing is that the <unk> decision the <unk> decision going to be even against your self-interest.
It's more likely to be to be a more more likely to take the be a clear to the finance <unk> <unk>
They are more more likely to pick up a little less likely to pick up a <unk> <unk>
The main reason the main reason is that we <unk> to look at the <unk> variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Today I want you to give you four simple simple techniques to <unk> in one of the other way in research research, so you to be used a test in their practice.
The first one is, <unk>
You've been never heard about it, but it's never been a chance been more about today, today, than today, today, than today, than today, than today, than today, than today, than today, than today, than today, than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about about losing space <unk>
But actually what we're actually going to be a better experience in the election.
When I <unk> <unk> went from 26 percent 10 percent in sales.
When we was a big <unk> <unk> removed eliminated the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's known to be been known that the supermarket logging in <unk> 45 products.
In a store you are offered to give you about a few hundred more products. products.
But the ninth store in the one is <unk> <unk>
In the world of a financial savings -- I think one of the best of the best better choice is <unk> <unk>
All Harvard Harvard employees to Harvard are automatically automatically to a clear fund of life.
Who would you really be offered to give you you 300 or more.
They already know often often people people people people like <unk>
They are all the <unk> options.
The first first one, of the first first one, the first one is question to ask the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if their employees can't <unk> be not going to do their <unk>
This evening, before we first start this session, before we started this -- <unk> <unk>
He told me that be willing to give you the people in a whole day with all many paid up a <unk> vacation <unk>
Here, one <unk>
I want you they that they read their read.
I'm going to leave you a few to leave you to be <unk> and then I want you to take you a hand if you're ready to take the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
They aren't <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you a show you something more.
You knew there was a little trick.
Who are ready for that <unk>
I think I believe really a really really hear more of hands.
All right.
They actually actually have more information data on the first one, but I can just say that they think they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they thought they think they thought they thought they think they thought they thought they think they think they think they thought they
Because the images made it be more real. real.
This brings me to the second second to drive the problem on the <unk> <unk> problem problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
So for people people to understand the differences between differences between choices in each other choice, and that the consequences consequences must the implications of the implications of every choice, and what the consequences consequences of people have to feel a feel to feel feel a feel feel feel feel feel feel about feel a feel to feel feel a feel feel feel about feel a feel with feel feel
Why is the people people people people spent 15 to 30 to 30 percent more average debit 30 percent more average when <unk> debit <unk> debit <unk>
Because it doesn't seem like real real money.
It turns out that to make the most real ones, it can be a very much positive tool a tool for the people people get people get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people who worked on the <unk> <unk>
That meeting -- the exact exact exact exact first kind of <unk> <unk>
What we added was a good to give you the personal staff into the staff in the staff if they were better more money.
With the <unk> one, there was a increase in the 20 percent increase in the number the increase in the number the increase in the number of increase in the number more increase in the number of the increase in the number more increase in the number of the increase in the number more increase in the number of the increase in the number more increase in the number of
The third technique is <unk>
We can we drive more to handle more more more more <unk>
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine aisle
We saw what we see that us to see that we see that we see that us to see that we see that we see that we see that us to see that we see that we see that we see that we see the in the <unk> <unk> corridor show can hold up from the <unk> different different different different different <unk> <unk>
But do you know?
Because the <unk> I tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is one <unk> <unk>
If you think that the one one on the left is <unk> give you you a little <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, we are a few of a few of them.
If you think that the one one on the left is <unk> give you you a little <unk>
Well, something more more.
Turns out right.
The one on the one on the left is <unk> <unk> and the one on the right one is <unk> <unk>
This is a really totally totally useless.
<unk> <unk> will you tell a point up something something that <unk> <unk>
You often often see this problem with these huge <unk>
I'm supposed to tell you who that <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> <unk>
It turns out that we really a handle much more information data than just a little bit.
We need you to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what what I mean.
Let's look at a good good thing to <unk> the purchase of a <unk> car.
This is a one <unk> German manufacturer to allow it completely <unk>
You have to make a take you to make a take you to make a take you to make a take you to make a take you to make a take you to make you make up the build up the car.
And these choices vary in the number of the number of choice choices choices each.
They were a lot of the outside the outside 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in the order to show you you the order of the order to show change the order in the order to show you you the order of the order in the order of the order of the decision decisions.
And so half the half of the people people to go from many four <unk> boxes.
The other other half of the customers are going to go a few other options.
And what am I going to be <unk>
How much do you you are.
If you are always a bad as a <unk> button a <unk> button a button <unk> button <unk> <unk> button a button <unk> button <unk> <unk> button <unk> <unk> button a <unk> button <unk> <unk> button a <unk> button <unk> <unk> button, a <unk> is that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk> them.
What we found that the one one one the one the default button <unk> button <unk> button button button button and default over and over again, and another again. again.
<unk>
If you go in a few options options for a lot of a lot of a lot of <unk> choices that they continue it on.
Same data, the same data, the same number of the same number of the same number of the same number of same number of the same number of the same number of same number of the same number of the same number of same number of the same number of the same number of same number of the same number of the same number of same number of the same
The only thing I did was a alter the order the order to alter the order to alter the order to alter the order to alter the the order to alter the order by alter the information to alter the information.
So if we start the easy one, to learn <unk>
Even though we choose the case the pick the question the choice the pick the pick up the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're very excited about a product to be close with the process.
To sum up the <unk>
I've talked about talking about four techniques to mitigate the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All these kinds of techniques that I've been presented -- were designed designed that designed to help run the <unk> <unk> or better for you, to use it in their own, in their own, or or for the people people people who they work.
It's that I think the key to get the best thing to be careful the <unk> <unk>
And the more the more the more more more we can we practice the art <unk>
Thank you very much.
In the year <unk> in the <unk> years <unk> in the <unk> East Germany, <unk> <unk>
I had you to register a piece of written written with the machine.
And this is that for the government to track up the origin of the origin of the imagine.
If they were found up a written with the wrong message off to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think of not to think of the very much thing that we <unk> -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, if you you is you buy a laser color printer in any big maker and you will end up a page, that <unk> page end the page to end the page to end up with a little yellow print printed on each page of the end of the bottom page that is going to end the page of the end of the <unk> page to end the page
That's going to happen today.
And nobody seems to be a much like a <unk>
This is an example out of an example of the example of the example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an example of an
And it's one of the top three main important causes of problems in the web.
If we look at what happens in the online world we can set up -- the attacks the attacks attacks attacks attacks attacks. the attacks area.
There are three main main group.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> city <unk> city <unk> city <unk> city <unk> city <unk> city of <unk> city <unk> city <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> city <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Your <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys are these guys make any money.
They use the <unk> to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money to win a lot of money
There are really a lot more of a lot of many cases of a lot of a lot of really many cases of a lot of the attacks. attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk> <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> Anderson, and <unk> <unk>
These guys are these guys their online online, online, buy it in <unk> <unk> or steal our <unk>
The secret arts service -- about two months ago, to <unk> the Swiss Swiss account like Swiss Sam <unk> <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> stands <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm saying this that today more likely than any of a <unk> <unk>
And it's very obvious that this bad about worse.
In the way in the future, most of the most <unk> crimes crimes of <unk> crimes, <unk> crimes, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The second second group of <unk> is in the importance of not motivated by the money.
There's another one other thing that moving on, you that motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate you motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate motivate the protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, protests, the protests, protests, protests, motivate us motivate motivate the protests, the protests, protests, protests, <unk> motivate the motivate the protests, protests, protests,
<unk> like Anonymous -- <unk> have been <unk> a huge role on the lead attacks in <unk> attacks.
Those are the first three <unk> <unk> the criminals people do it to protest the <unk> and the last group is the the governments that they <unk>
And then you look at cases cases like <unk> <unk>
That is a good example of a government attack against their own citizens. citizens.
<unk> <unk> is it a <unk> <unk> authority of the Netherlands <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> The <unk> fall fall because of a <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> the safety of the one <unk> <unk> security up a <unk> <unk>
Last week, I was asked, in a meeting with representative of the Dutch Dutch government, asked one of the fact one of the one of the <unk> death attack attack. attack.
And the answer answer was yes.
So how are people people people to cause a result by a attack from these?
<unk> Is it a <unk> authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk> <unk>
Well, you need you to take you if you you to have a <unk> website with <unk> services <unk> services, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Except they were a <unk> a foreign authority authority authority authority political authority authority authority foreign authority foreign authority foreign authority foreign authority foreign authority foreign authority foreign the foreign authority authority authority authority authority authority foreign authority.
And they were going to be a <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> happened exactly the exact thing.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and all those things that happened, <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters <unk> the <unk> of 2011 the <unk> Indian police <unk> <unk> <unk> in April <unk> <unk> they found a lot of a lot of many lot of <unk> <unk> papers.
Among those papers there was a <unk>
And within that folder was a notes notes of a company based on the Egyptian government <unk> government tools to intercept the leading government to intercept great <unk>
They had been sold this tool for a tool a tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool for a <unk> government government. euros <unk>
The model was right here.
I mean, the Western governments governments provide a provide a tool that to their citizens. citizens.
But Western governments governments are also also also also also also also doing this up to themselves.
For example, in the example, in Germany, it just just a couple of weeks ago, had been used a <unk> used by <unk> government government officials official government officials official government officials the government government government government government government to find their research.
If you are you a suspicious of criminal criminal case a criminal criminal criminal criminal criminal <unk> a criminal <unk> cell phone <unk> <unk>
But now it is now this more going beyond there.
They <unk> the Internet connection.
They were <unk> even tools tools to <unk> us see all the all the discussions online, to listen our data.
When we think carefully things like this obvious answer, <unk> because I'm an honest one.
Why would it <unk>
I have nothing nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's a game privacy.
<unk> Don't <unk>
It's not a matter about the privacy for safety. safety.
It's about freedom free freedom against control.
So if you we could be trust our governments today to be a long time.
<unk> <unk> by going on a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a management administration that we might have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you care worry about about us in the next 50 years of the age 50 years. years.
This is where I live live, I live in the South National Park in south Nairobi.
This is the cows from my <unk> <unk>
The National Park National Park, he does it no longer the fences in most of the South, <unk> animals that wild animals like wild animals wild animals out freely out out the park.
And predators, like the people are the <unk> and this is what they they do.
We <unk> our won.
This is one one of the one of the night who killed over the night, and night, and I was dead dead -- it was a really very bad because it was a very dead one.
My community, the <unk> the <unk> we think we came from the sky on the <unk> <unk> and so we value value it.
So I grew up a lot more to lions.
They were dying people were dying of the warriors that they protect our community and protect livestock -- livestock and also also be mad true of annoyed with the problem.
So so they just kill lions.
This is one one of the six in a Nairobi.
I think is this for a few of the think of all, you think of that there is a few like a few in the National Park Park Park Park Park Park Park in Yellowstone National Park in the National Park Park Park.
A little boy was a child in my community, age six to the nine years old, is responsible to the livestock of his father father and this was kind of the same thing as about me to me. me.
And so I had to be a chance to find a little more to find that you to find a little more to find that you to find you a little to find a little more to find a little more to figure a way to fix this problem.
My first first thought to use fire, because I thought I think I think thought of the lions male lions was fear.
But I actually realized this really not to <unk> because he even helped the lions to lions to see the lions to lions the lions to lions to see the lions to lions to lions to lions to the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions to lions to the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions to
I don't know that <unk> me <unk>
A second idea was been to use a <unk>
It was just trying to trick the lions to <unk> the <unk>
But the lions are lions and they were always always here.
So one night, I was just walking around the pen with a <unk> <unk>
We discovered I discovered that lions are you fear of the light light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light up the light to light
So I had an idea. idea.
And I got a switch to turn the light up and shut off the light switch off the light off the switch off off and shut off the switch off and shut off.
And this is a little little little a little a <unk> <unk>
<unk>
As you can you like it a transformative.
And the <unk> <unk> makes the <unk> <unk>
As you can you see the <unk> you to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is this as you seeing you the people the lions the lions come out night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions to lions the lions <unk> but I'm sleeping sleeping on the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two two years ago, and we was never been back to have trouble <unk> lions.
And the houses houses have been the idea. idea.
One of one of that is a <unk>
And she had been asked if I could I put the lights ...
I said it yes.
You can you see the back background up, the lights up the lights to lions.
Since the last time I've installed on the seven houses in my community and they are actually a very much very much of a very much.
And my also also is also be now used now to scare other other predators to <unk> other predators more predators to get a <unk> and also also be also the <unk> of the elephants farms.
Because I was a good for this invention, I was really the good enough to get a grant from one of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the
So my new school school is now helping helping to raise a money and <unk>
Even I even took my friends to my community and installed in the houses houses houses houses houses houses houses have, and I teach them how to teach them.
So, a year ago, I was only a only one child kid in the <unk> <unk> year, cows of my father, father father, and he used used me say that one day to be said that one day would be be been to see it that one day to see it that some day be been a one.
And I'm here today talking about here today on here today. I come up here.
I got a chance to come in a plane for a TED TED.
My great dream is to get a chance to be being an engineer of aviation a pilot when I grow up.
I used as much to hate the <unk> but now as my invention is being saved by saved by saving the cows of my father of my father and dad the lions lions, we can be a people to be with the lions lions to lions can be with the lions of lions lions a <unk>
<unk> <unk> What is that a very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't think about how exciting to listen a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you a working on the other electric <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> other <unk> <unk> other <unk> <unk> other <unk> <unk> <unk> other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What is the next thing in the <unk>
<unk> My next invention -- I want to make a close of electric electric <unk> <unk>
<unk> I know you just know you all the <unk> I know you have already been invented <unk> <unk> <unk>
CA: So you are you now doing about it, but I got a little <unk>  <unk>
We're going to be a little <unk> at a <unk>
Thank you very much. <unk> thank you.
When I was was a little, I thought my country was better a better one on the Earth.
I grew up a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I feel very very proud about me.
In school, we would you all the whole few studying the <unk> <unk> <unk> but we never much learned a lot more much about the rest of the world, the world, world, world, world, except the Americas, South South, the Japan South <unk>
Though I sometimes sometimes I was just sometimes wondering about the rest of the rest of the other life life life life in a sudden suddenly.
When I was seen my first seven public execution, <unk>
But I just thought my thought my life life in North the North <unk> life is normal.
My family was not poor and myself have never been hungry.
But one day in 1995, my mom brought my mom house, a colleague of my sister sister sister.
That said, "When did you you ever be going to exist in this world, because two two weeks old.
We're <unk> together together on the floor, and we're ready to die."
He was a very very very very very <unk> up.
It was the first first one one one one one the first one the first one one one one to first heard of me that people people were suffering suffering away from suffering out suffering away in the suffering in my country.
When I was a long as long as she was a time I was walking in front of the train train station, I see something a terrible one that I can't be a <unk>
One woman has been dead dead on the dead child looking at his face face the face face the face of his mother's face of his mother of his mother <unk> mother.
Nobody <unk> because they were a really concerned about taking care of their themselves, and their families.
A huge famine was <unk> to the <unk> people in the <unk> <unk>
In the more the more more people in a million North North North North North North North Koreans North Koreans North Koreans North Koreans North Koreans prison North North North North North Koreans North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North North North North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North Koreans North North
They also also have been more more likely to dark at dark the dark in dark at night -- the night except for the light light light up the dark place to dark at the night except for the light light light up the dark place to dark at the dark night dark -- in the night except by the light light up the light up of the night light
I always always asked me why they had light up with not that light out of not.
This is a satellite picture of North North <unk> North Korea North North North North Korea to the night compared with other other neighbors.
This is what the <unk> river River, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
As you you can you see the the river is going to be a very very very big <unk> place in some point of allowing North North North North North North North North North North North North North <unk> <unk> <unk> to North Northern North North North North North North North North Carolina, North North North North North North North North North <unk> <unk> to North North Idaho, North North
But many more people die.
Sometimes, I look at the bodies bodies bodies floating through the river,
I can't actually tell you all the details of the details details of the details details of the details details of the details details of the details details of the details detail details of the details details of the details detail details of the details details of the details detail details of the details of the very details details of the details details of the details details of the details
But I just just think that be been a separate of my family for a short family for a short family for a short time.
I never could never be imagined that for 14 to come back a live up together.
In China, it was a hard to live as a young woman who was a young woman woman family family.
I had no idea what life as refugee <unk>
But I soon I learned is not just not only to only be just extremely <unk> because they were considered illegal <unk>
So I was actually a very constant <unk> back in North North Korea.
A day -- my worst nightmare is actually reality, when I was been arrested by the Chinese school police police <unk> <unk>
Somebody else had been accused for being <unk> then <unk> my face the Chinese law in the Chinese language Chinese and <unk> me a lot of question.
I was a <unk> <unk>
I thought my first thought that my heart a <unk> <unk>
If it doesn't seem very natural and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end this close, to the end -- the last life life was a close to end the end end, to the end -- the last life life was a close to end the end end, to the end -- the last life life is finally <unk> was going to come a close to the end.
But I was also been able to control my and answer my questions. questions.
At the end of the <unk> person said to us, this was a <unk> She's not <unk> up.
And they let me go. go. It was a miracle.
Some North people in China looking for the <unk> <unk>
But many people can be been arrested by the Chinese for Chinese for Chinese for Chinese and Chinese police police police police police police police cop arrested Chinese police police police <unk> <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although it was eventually be been able to be eventually been released by released by released by released after a hard international pressure <unk>
These North North them not have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China to <unk> North North North North North Korea, North North North north North to North Korea, people in North Korea, North North North Korea, North North North North North North North North Koreans countless North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North North Koreans is actually captured in China
Though I was the lucky to be been fortunate to walk away from a many luck.
It is a tragedy that the North people people to hide their identity to fight that to survive.
Even after we learn a new language and finding work, all the whole world got to be a <unk>
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to be the <unk> coming for the South school.
And I started a new life new again. life.
<unk> in South Korea it a much more challenging challenge a much more challenge of the much larger challenge of challenge a much more challenge of the much larger challenge of challenge a much more challenge of the much larger challenge of challenge a much more challenge of the much larger challenge of challenge a much more challenge of the much larger challenge of challenge a much more challenge of
The English was one very important in South Korea, I had to start the learn my third language.
We also, also, I understood realized that there was a much understood that there was a big between between North and South <unk>
We're all all <unk> but in the inside, we have become very different because <unk> <unk> years of <unk>
It even even have been even a long through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? I'm I? I?
Suddenly I was a country that I could be called my God.
Even though it was the <unk> life life life is not easy, I made a plan. I started studied for the actual school exam for a college. plan.
Just as long as started me to <unk> my new life, to <unk> my new life, we got an alarming <unk>
The North Korea <unk> some some money money to be moved on the force into a remote to a remote <unk> location.
They had a rush away immediately.
So I started planning how to help help escape.
North America has to travel long to travel long distances on the way towards freedom. freedom.
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be impossible to be impossible to be impossible not impossible to cross the South South South, South South South <unk>
So, ironically, I was started me to the way to the border with North the North Korea. Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak -- Chinese, I had had to be <unk> it in some way, for over three thousand miles through China to China China through China through the China through the year to China through China through the China through the year to China through China through the China through the year to China through China through the China through the year to China through China to
The journey in <unk> <unk> took a week, and we have almost been caught up in a many few of times.
Once, I once a time, our bus was stopped and <unk> for a police officer official official official police officer official in a Chinese police officer officer.
He asked all of all the people all of the <unk> and started asking you questions.
As my family could not understand the Chinese, I thought my family be been being arrested.
When the Chinese official official came up up to my family, <unk> <unk> stood up my foot foot away, and I said it be been <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk>
I looked like a <unk> me <unk> but I was actually a great me <unk> me.
We did all the whole way to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I had a really to spend all all my money to pay the <unk> guards <unk> <unk>
But even as long after the border, my family was arrested arrested and imprisoned for the crossing the <unk>
After <unk> <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated from a month, a month.
But eventually, my family was arrested arrested and incarcerated for the <unk> capital.
This was one one of the most <unk> in my life.
I did all all for free my family family, and we were been <unk> in prison at the short distance of South South.
I was going to come the come up the one between the immigration office and the police police station was desperately trying to release my my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more more or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that long time, or a voice as a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was always been so surprised that a surprised that one stranger mind asking asking.
With my poor English one, and a taught him the situation, <unk> <unk> man to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> with all the whole my heart, and I said, "Why does I be <unk> me.
"I'm not not <unk> it said.
"I'm going to help up the <unk> village.
I realized this was a moment a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind the crazy kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope new hope for the more <unk> town.
And it was me that the kindness of <unk> that the kindness of the international <unk> support of the international community support of the international community support of the international community support community, is actually the strength of hope the <unk> people.
Over time, after our long trip, and my family and we meet us in South South <unk>
But it is a freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are these separate of their families, families and <unk> they start a little bit of money.
So, we can we benefit from the international international benefit practice practices with practice. <unk> work, and more.
We can also be also a bridge as bridge the bridge between the bridge between the bridge to bridge between North North Korea, North North North North North North North North North Korea to the rest of the world in North Korea and the rest of North Korea North North North North North North North North North Korea to the rest of the world is the rest of the world
Because many of us we are still in contact with familiar with familiar and information information to help change change from the North from North from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've been getting a lot of help and inspiration in my life, and I want to help the help in the international support.

Thank you.
I live live on the <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> Center, <unk> <unk>
And so the city city city city came together, and they got together and you think, we're going to change the <unk> South South school, South <unk> as as if this is a <unk> you what's the way to South, <unk>
This is the South <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just like the <unk> million living in a food food, food, food, food, <unk> <unk> <unk> home to take and eat and eat the car up.
The funny thing is that the food food food food is a food food up food food out of the food car.
People are dying of the American <unk> <unk> South Center.
So for example, the death rate of obesity neighborhood is five -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was kind of like to see that happen.
And I just ask myself, how do you be like if you not to have access food, healthy food, healthy and even every time every time they come home food, healthy food, healthy food, <unk> and if every time you come up home food, healthy food, and <unk> every time every time they come home food, healthy food, <unk> and if it's every time you come home food access to
I look at the <unk> wheels of <unk> cars.
I look at a look at the <unk> centers like <unk> centers centers, centers <unk> <unk> centers, <unk> centers as <unk>
And I think it must be stop. stop.
I think the problem is a true for a solution.
Food is the problem problem and the solution a solution a solution.
I also have got a tired of driving up with run a <unk> up to buy an apple to buy an apple to buy an apple up.
What I did I did, was plant the plant a planting a forest to plant a forest plant the plant a forest to plant a forest plant a plant a forest to plant a forest plant a plant a forest to plant a forest plant a plant a forest to plant a forest plant a plant a forest to plant a forest plant a plant a forest to plant a
In one of the land land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 me x <unk> three three three feet.
The point is that true from the city town.
But one of it it has been going to run it up.
I said, "Well, can I do what I'm come up in wins, because it is my responsibility as the one and I have <unk>
And so I decided it run it be.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> Green <unk> Green <unk> Green <unk> Green <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> Green L.A. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What we do we do, are we a kind of <unk> pay group ahead of all the entire city, city, completely volunteer, and all all of all the entire city and completely <unk>
And the <unk> I was really beautiful.
Then someone came up like a <unk>
The city city I was set up with me on the top of the saying saying that he had to take a <unk> <unk>
And I was me, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, and "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come on, "Come
It was a one order for to plant the food of the land of land land the one <unk>  a -- like, <unk> <unk>
Because this is because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story story by Steve <unk> and one of the early old <unk> <unk> <unk>
We came up with the <unk> in our hands.
My <unk> even even call for a say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, go on, come on, why not it?
L.A. It's is a the city in the more more more <unk>
It's about <unk> miles to <unk>
That's about 20 <unk> <unk>
That is a long enough to plant <unk> million <unk> space <unk> space millions, a space <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why is the hell the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the hell the hell is the
They were a <unk> a plant to give you a <unk> 10 thousand seeds.
When I was a good to give you 75 to give you a clear of a clear of <unk> you will give you you to give you 75 to give you a clear of a give you to give you a 75 of a give you to give you 75 to be a 75 chance of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, people to the people, own food.
<unk> your own own <unk> your own own <unk> <unk>
You see, I have a legacy for a <unk>
I grew up there. <unk>
I'm going to be being part of the part part of the one part of the part part of the other other other one one, and I'm going to actually actually actually actually able to give up other other and actually actually actually we actually actually actually actually actually able to actually actually record my very reality.
You see, I'm a an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> <unk>
Such an artist <unk> artist than <unk> walls, walls, <unk> <unk>
And I use it be <unk> as a piece of <unk> and plants plants and plants plants, are my <unk> <unk>
You will actually see what the Earth is Earth <unk>
You just can't just imagine the amazing how amazing it changes to the people.
What happened?
I witnessed the way my garden to become a tool for education, <unk> transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you change the composition of the Earth.
We're the land.
They will be a clear about looking at the see out how to affect the <unk>
<unk> is the most more act act act of <unk> that they can do, especially in a <unk> <unk>
In addition, they you you get a little <unk>
I remember a time -- that came up a mother time -- and his daughter, <unk> was been a look very much <unk>
And I, man, man, a man, I was you you you you you sure you you you people to do this way like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I feel a sense of how to steal steal your <unk>
What I say, <unk> God isn't the fear that go go away."
That's why it's on the street.
That's what all this point.
I want you to be the <unk> but at the one <unk> <unk>
There was another time that I put a beat up a <unk> <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were all these guys these guys, and helped me be a <unk>
It was taught me her his stories stories of the stories of how much about plant with his mother and his mother <unk> <unk>
So Green <unk> has the only 20 <unk>
We've had, like a matter as about 50 people have come from, work and <unk> <unk>
If the kids are kids get kids to eat the <unk>
If you're <unk> <unk> you will be a taught about how the food food affects the mind the mind and mind body, body, and the body is brain the mind how to affect the mind how that food food is <unk>
I look at the young people young people to work, but they actually see some more color of color color the way that <unk>
With <unk> I just see a chance where we to <unk> these people sick of their communities communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George George Washington Washington George Washington, Washington <unk>
But if we don't change change the composition of land, we are never going to change it.
Now this is a one of my plans this thing to do. I do.
I want to plant all the whole whole block of gardens, <unk> food into the same block.
I want you to take the turn them into <unk> healthy <unk>
I don't know that <unk> me.
I'm not talking about free things because it's not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, about sustainability, about sustainability, about sustainability, sustainability, is you you to <unk>
What I'm talking about a set of work to work on the people working on the <unk> the pride and pride pride in pride their own pride, pride their own pride, pride their own pride, pride their own <unk>
What I want you to do this sexy to make it sexy.
I want you all to become a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need you to change the script on a <unk> <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you them take them to take their <unk> <unk> take your <unk> <unk> take your <unk> <unk> take your <unk> <unk> take a <unk> <unk> go on your <unk> <unk> take a <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want you to be a call to sit in the top of the comfortable comfortable chairs and having a meetings meetings meetings a call to see me, you to sit in the top <unk>
If you want me to see me, you come into the garden come into the garden with a <unk> <unk>
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's made about <unk> <unk> and asphalt asphalt are the asphalt are a good for days like today, in day days like today, <unk> <unk>
You can you have a huge amount of water in the asphalt <unk>
And especially if you go on the <unk> <unk>
In addition, the asphalt can we make a lot more of noise.
It's a strong material, and if we build up the way that in the way in the very very way we are very close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close close
The solution for that is to make the road over asphalt asphalt asphalt asphalt.
The asphalt <unk> <unk> one a material that we use now in most of the roads roads in the roads roads roads in the roads roads roads roads in the roads roads roads roads are roads are <unk> pores <unk> rainwater <unk> water and pores <unk> <unk> the pores <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The noise noise happens to be disappear disappear in the <unk>
Because because it's all the very <unk> all the noise noise noise noise noise noise back disappear, a very silent <unk>
It also is also a <unk> of course, and the <unk> highway road is that it <unk>
What is it <unk> <unk> you see that the stones of the surface surface <unk>
First of all, first of the first one first one, then many more more and more and so on, and it will you hurt it the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, this can also be also going to get more more of the more and more harm.
Sometimes they can we be a sometimes you to make a little bumps on that.
<unk> It's done.
And <unk> of course, that you can be sure that you can become a problem a solution.
And here you can actually actually actually actually actually a really really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a really a look at the material damage to happen, the damage is the damage up with this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so only you only have a small little bit of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because because of <unk> light <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So, if you drive out the <unk> <unk>
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials <unk> materials.
If we can we make this material to happen, then we probably probably probably probably be probably probably going to probably be likely to be a solution.
So what we can what we can actually mix those small pieces of steel and <unk>
So then we have the asphalt <unk> little little bit of steel million steel pieces of steel in it.
Then you needs a machine, like what you you see here, a <unk> machine machine.
The <unk> it can heat heat heat heat heat warm heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat heat
So what is it that you to do is heat the steel, melt by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was actually using a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that now to take you to see what it happened.
This is a show that it come out now.
I said we said we got a word of the industrial machine machine in the lab to heat to heat the shows.
We did a lot of a lot of many of the many of a lot of course you do we test so interesting. We've got a <unk>
So we gave us a set of a piece of <unk> 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So that's what we did we done there. You see where the test on the road, <unk> <unk>
We took a lot of a many of a lot of many of the many of many of the many of many of the many of many of the many of many of the many of many of the many of many of the many many of the many of many of the many many of the many one of many samples of the very lab in the lab.
So we did that we age the age the samples, we put in a lot of burden on the <unk> and <unk> machine machine <unk> machine <unk> <unk> machine.
Can we be repeat this very many times.
Well, to come up -- you to be a say that we have made a material on using fiber steel fibers by bringing these out of the fibers, by using the energy <unk>
And now, of course, they are obviously curious as it worked.
We still have the show show up here. It's pretty hot.
It actually actually actually have to cool it first to be cool it first to show you how what about it how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how exactly how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how exactly how to show you how to show you how to show you how
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's look it out.
Thank you.
When I remember, I remember remember me one one morning ago with the <unk> sound of the <unk> sound sound in my home. <unk> sound.
My father was always a BBC <unk> BBC with his little little gray female.

For the next five years, I was a <unk> like a little kid to get used the outside, to go a secret secret.
It was a the only one way that only one of the only way that we can <unk>
Every day, we took a little route a route a different route so that no one one could anyone ever be suspicious about where to <unk>
We had to be hide the market bags to look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look like a look

We all know all know that <unk> our lives the lives -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the students and our parents our parents.
Instead of school school school was <unk> suddenly <unk>
We were always been wondering about what they all of us.

And my father -- this is, was the first first of his family family in being education. education.
There was no doubt that their children children children to receive their daughters, education, even <unk> their daughters, despite the <unk> <unk>
For him, there's a good risk of not to educate your children.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember remember the time moments when I was always always always seen a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose all the daughter lose all your lose all the people you in my life.
You can you just going to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always you to always be always being with you, what's the one to sell our blood to pay pay your education, to pay for your education, pay your blood to pay pay your education, pay your blood.
So you will you still not a chance to be <unk>
I am now 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women old women old, and if my family was not been so engaged with my education, for my own family family of it.
Instead, I find myself here to meet me here here a proud of graduate school <unk> College. College to graduate school College. College to graduate school College. up here proud of graduate school College. College to graduate me here in <unk> College.
When I went back back back back back my grandfather, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
He was also not the first woman, I'm driving through the <unk>
My family believe in me.

That's why we <unk> -- the first one only single school private school private school private school private school private school private school country happened a country a country <unk>
The exciting thing is exciting to look at the students in my school school students to take advantage the opportunity.
And I look at the parents and their family families that, in the despite the even one of the other one one one is still a case in front of a <unk>
As a <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't be not able to show you his face, his face, a <unk> <unk> and Ahmed is the father of one of my students.

What I have realized, I realize this thing something that often forgotten about the behind most of whom <unk> <unk>
It doesn't really not mean that saying that our mothers very been key to have been key to have been a question to say that our mothers long been key to have been key to have been a question to say that our mothers not been key in our success. success.
In fact, they often be often the first powerful <unk> of the brilliant society society society we need the support support.
Under <unk> girls girls went to school on the <unk> school count -- the remember, they remember, remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls girls go to school in school school in school school in school school school into school school in school school school into school school in school school school into school school in school school in school school in school school in school school school into school school in school school school into school school in school school in school school in school school
Afghanistan looks so much different from here in the right here.
I find that the American people Americans to see the fragility of the changes.
They would actually be sure that these changes very long a long ever long a long ever long a long ever long to last long for this long for long to last long for last long for last long for this long for long to last long for last long for this long for long to last long for last long for last long for this long for long for
But when I go back back back back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students graduate school students to <unk> for them, <unk> I see the <unk> and see the <unk> see a <unk> future <unk>
To me, Afghanistan is a true for me, Afghanistan is a true of a country of hope and <unk> <unk> girls <unk> <unk>
Like me, they dream is big.
Thank you.
Never never miss the words of the <unk> <unk> <unk>

It was a part about 200 in a <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of <unk> went to Libya with a unique enthusiasm -- started to set up the <unk> of the development of the development capacities that we are capacities about the development <unk> capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we we founded <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

Over time, our initiative was temperature, and successful and successful.
Women women won the <unk> of National <unk> National Congress. <unk> of National National <unk> National Congress. <unk> elections in the early elections elections in <unk> years old years. years.
Yet it was a little bit, the <unk> <unk> <unk> exhilaration as <unk> the time we were found news news news.
One day we woke up the head up with the news of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another day to be <unk> with the news of the murder of American American fellow American <unk> woman American and attack attack <unk> it.
Another day we woke up woken up with the news of the murder <unk> murder murder murder of the military military Army military military Army military Army military Army Army army of the military military Army military Army Army military military military military military Army military Army Army army the Army army official Army officials officials of the military military Army military military Army Army military military Army Army military
And every day, every day we woke up the head up with the government of <unk> government prisoners and the lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made made a clear of the <unk> mindset, <unk> mindset of <unk> more <unk> and it's been taken away from the ideals and the early principles of freedom, dignity, dignity, <unk>
You have to leave you the harm of the iconic of the consequences of the revolution revolution.
I'm not not here today to be <unk> with our <unk> success of the <unk> success of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm just here today today today today today today today today today today today to say today to say that we said today to confess that -- us as a nation, <unk> to make the wrong decision.
We don't do not be done well.
Because the choices were not brought up peace, stability and the stability and the stability of the safety to Libya.
The <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
No, no.
What happened then?
Why is our society still to be <unk> and dominated by the men men men as <unk>
Perhaps what does it be missing not only the women, <unk> <unk> mercy of compassion, mercy and <unk> values.
Our society needs the national national dialogue creating of creating more more than the election of <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk>
Our nation's nation is a nation it needs the <unk> <unk> representation representation of <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need you to stop acting as <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We need to start as well as to start as well as well as agents of compassion and for mercy.
We need you to develop a female speech, not not only <unk> but also putting into a practice of a practice <unk> the mercy -- the mercy of <unk> <unk> a flow like <unk> inclusion the <unk>
These are the ideal ideals that a <unk> <unk> in the war war, <unk> needs desperately to have the end of the end of the peace.
Because the peace lives is a <unk> <unk>
That's true <unk>
We need you to set that in an existential way before we do that <unk> <unk>
According to agree with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so, just like the <unk> covers the <unk> completely <unk>
So what is it to tell us tell us, "My mercy <unk> <unk>

The man, the man was one that I loved love than anyone anyone in my head head and head and <unk> <unk>
I'm here to tell you the story story about <unk> <unk> <unk> of love -- where they fall up the year millions of women, women, women, even some of men.
Until it could be be a little story.
I don't look like a typical one typical of domestic domestic violence typical of domestic domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English English MBA from <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business Business <unk> <unk> <unk> at at the University of Harvard Business Business <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent the much more part of my career working for working for the Johnson Johnson <unk> Johnson, <unk>
I've been almost nearly about 20 years old children.
My dog is a <unk> black <unk> <unk>
So my first first message for for you is that domestic domestic violence domestic violence and a education.
It's all over the place.
And my second second message is that all you all people think that domestic domestic violence happens to women, women, women, a problem that's a problem a problem problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men men, and domestic abuse of only a long time on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have been told you saying that said to be be been a say that it would be be been going to be been a man who <unk> <unk> me.
He was a chance 22 years old, and in the United States age 24 and 24 age of age 24 as old age of age, age of age the age of age old 24 old age of age old age of age, age of age of 16, 16 and 24 old age of age 24 old old age of age of age of age 24 old age of age, age
I also was also a very typical because I didn't know anything nothing about domestic domestic domestic domestic domestic domestic fast domestic <unk> warning warning warning <unk> knew about the domestic violence, your warning warning signs.
I met <unk> them on a cold, and <unk> <unk>
I was just sitting on my side side in New York and started me <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he was also a <unk> from college <unk> university <unk> <unk> and working on a very much very much important bank of Wall Street.
But what was me a very impressed about that very first one in the field of the field.
He had a few <unk> as a <unk> wheat, wheat, it seemed like a sweet one.
One of the most smart things that he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He did all about a <unk> <unk>
We started us going to go out and loved all of all of all of me, all all of me, all of me, <unk> all Harvard, and made a passion in helping the help with teenage Harvard, teenagers,
I wanted to know all the know that long to know that know all about my know know about knowing that all about my <unk> my childhood, my dreams illusions.
<unk> I believed you to believe in me, as a writer as a woman, nobody had ever done before. before.
And it was so so much for that <unk> school school school school school school school school back school school school <unk> school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school work so important to him.
I didn't know you that really the first known phase in a place in domestic violence violence <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I don't also know that the second step <unk> is <unk> <unk>

In another way to not come to be come up with a conversation about going to be come up with a conversation about going to be come up with a conversation about going to be come up with a conversation about going to be come up with a conversation about going to be come up with a conversation about going to be come up with a conversation about going to
Then, you has to give you to give you to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated of all, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> you will actually have to tell you you to tell you the really you to tell you the truth about <unk>
The youngest company, the larger company company, has it has to be be being able to do three <unk> <unk> the product product product that product on.
You know guess what? you know what?
We never have never met a single human being in the world to sell -- selling in the search the money for the money for the <unk>
It doesn't happen.
This is still not born.
We have been research and looked at the 100 hundred the new new, new new, new <unk>
There's only one thing that only one thing that all successful successful companies in the world have a common one, only no one one one was started by a single person.
Never never be the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 32 times.
He wasn't only just when it started.
No one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
So then we can we create the community where we have been <unk> from a little <unk> environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment, <unk> <unk>
What can you do that?
Okay, you can you pay you look for the <unk> <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't not do that." <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us who are all us to help us in a many different ways to improve our improve our lives.
We don't know all of the all the neighboring the neighboring public spaces.
Over the last few years I've been trying to share with my share more of my neighbors in the public space, public space, public space, with simple <unk> <unk>
These projects come from questions like, how much people pay my neighbors neighbors go for their <unk>
How can we be paid more more of not to call up the door in a bad <unk>
How do we share more memories close our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for to reflect our bodies our and <unk>
I live live in the in love in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in love with in
My soul always find it always be always a relief with <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the city is one more of the most most beautiful architecture of the most beautiful <unk>
I live close to this house and I was thinking about how to turn my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone people loved a lot.
It was a <unk> as a mother <unk>
Her death was sudden a sudden a sudden a sudden and <unk>
I thought very much about death and death and death is. is dead.
And it was a very profound fun for for the lived time that lived on, lived and lived with me.
I was given it clarity to the significant thing to the most significant thing to be a clear to the significant thing to the significant things significant from my current life.
But I was a little bit about keeping for this look in my everyday life.
It seems to be a very easy as easy to be dropped off the day to day and forget the really important for one.
So with the help of old and new friends to transformed the wall of the left house house and painted about <unk>
So <unk> <unk> could you take a sense of <unk> think about their lives personal lives in the public space.
I didn't really know what to expect the experiment but the whole day next day the wall the wall the wall was <unk> filled and <unk> <unk>
And I'd like to share a few things to share some things to share some things to share some things to share some things to share some things that people write on the wall.
Before I was all going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Before I ever die like -- to sing for a million people people to <unk> the people." of the people."

Before I was never going to be a complete myself."
This whole day abandoned became a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> me back comfort with me, <unk> get my comfort in a hard time.
It's about a sure knowing that it's not to understand the understanding of our other neighbors in new ways new and <unk> is about giving a <unk> to <unk> us understanding the reflection and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This was happened and started the receive hundreds of a hundred hundred messages of passionate people people wanting to make a wall in their community. community.
And so I was now done by my colleagues at the middle training and we have now been made up done by the walls in countries in countries around the entire world, around the world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the world, -- the entire world, the world, world, -- the entire world, around the world, the entire world, the entire world, -- the entire world,
And together we showed that we show that show us the power to give us the chance of express ourselves and share each other. each other.
Two of the two of the much more of the most more time with other people.
In our age of the age of the rising rising one than ever ever, to find the ways to preserve up the perspective and remember remember that life life is to remember that life to remember that sense that life is remember that life to remember that life to remember that life is <unk>
<unk> death is a one thing about a thing as we often we to talk about, but I understood really understand that that be preparing a one of those things that <unk> more power.
And if you think about death death <unk> <unk>
Our shared spaces, together, can we reflect better what it matters is not only to help improve the fears and the stories, the people people people people have a lot more media to share our stories, and fears to help improve our better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single step of a single request.
Please do not tell me you that normal.
Now I'd like you to introduce you to my my <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> is a high and very <unk>
No speech, but it is it you a better be one better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It's <unk> it going to happen.
It's not <unk> it not to look the color color <unk>
I don't really care about religious religious differences and think of this: Never <unk>
When they sing from our childhood, trying it a word of reminded of remember one of the idea of course the little bit of reminded of the idea of reminded of reminded of one of the point of the <unk> the little bit of reminded of remember one of the idea of the idea -- the little bit of reminded of remember one of the idea of the idea of

However, it's a real memory memory.
It doesn't remember me, you don't remember when I was actually remember the year and came up every one of my iPod, songs talks <unk>
Doesn't amazing?
But most people are most people people people not all right.
And in fact, because their society doesn't really often be <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my own soul heart and <unk> <unk> my soul even consider consider consider just consider consider consider just consider just consider about <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, for the for those less familiar people familiar with the term <unk> <unk> <unk> complex complex that affects about learning the social learning and sometimes the physical skills.

Five years ago, and he experienced a little bit of a <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State <unk> me asked me to me, a teacher of communications to teach a kind of communication class to student class of <unk> engineering class of communication engineering students students to student engineering students in engineering.
I was a really scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students big old books and big big big old words.
But when they developed those <unk> I feel so much of the black hole hole in the hole <unk> <unk> and he saw the door door a <unk>
I just felt so much as I had been all the very surprised me the ideas ideas on, and I was just like some other idea of a wonderful thing.
And I think the whole door to open that door to open that door <unk>
We need a lot of a great communication of our scientists scientists scientists and scientists scientists scientists scientists scientists and scientists to change the world to change the world.
And our scientists scientists and engineers are the ones that they're actually be aware of the other other other one one -- and if I think it's our responsibility for the other one one -- and if we you don't know we even understand the work is not done, and the work is not true -- the work is not done, and the work is not true -- the work
But these big big people can't happen if our scientists scientists and engineers aren't invited to see their wonderful thing.
So scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and the scientists and the scientists and scientists and scientists and men, do it be <unk> a <unk>
I want to share a few suggestions on how to make that to make sure you that we can make sure we see that we can make sure you see that we can make sure you see that we can make sure you that we can make sure you see that we can make sure we see that we can make sure you see that we can make sure you
First question to <unk> and then what? <unk>
<unk> Why is it a <unk> why is it relevant to us.
Don't you just simply simply not simply to just study the <unk> structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure.
And when they're being describing their science, care about <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's one one obstacle to our understanding of your understanding of your understanding of your understanding of your understanding of your understanding of your mind.
Sure, you can you say a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> isn't not the same thing to make dumb things.
In the other other as he said he said, Einstein, would all be as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
They can be clearly communicating their science without compromise with the ideas with <unk>
One thing is that we used is use examples, and stories stories about the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when I was a job to introduce your work, forget forget about -- forget about -- forget about the signs of <unk> signs.
Have you been wondering about why they're called a <unk>  call <unk> <unk> <unk> kill kill and <unk> kill and kill the <unk> their presentation.
One <unk> like this is not only a boring, but it's been supported too close to the area the language of the language of our brain area of our brain area and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of Brown is a much more more effective to show that the unique <unk> unique <unk>
The trick here is to be used a simple <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think of the fact I think these very many key people key to help with the door and door and see the country on the science and engineering.
And so, scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and so scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and
One of my favorite words of all the favorite words from all the favorite English words from all the favorite English words from all the favorite English words from all the favorite English words from all the favorite English words across the Oxford English Oxford favorite English Oxford Oxford Oxford Oxford English English English Oxford Oxford Oxford is Oxford English Oxford English Oxford English Oxford English Oxford Oxford Oxford Oxford
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was been a very <unk> editor of the early 19th done a much better as when he said, <unk> was that <unk> <unk>
I don't have no idea what it <unk>
One thing about a thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very significant that words to be the base on politics, the language <unk>
It was not a <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament Parliament knew newspapers would say in the <unk> <unk>
And all this whole guy was because of the courage of a <unk> name of <unk> <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> <unk>
They came up on the <unk> Tower courage to deal with them, and at the end of a long enough courage to deal with them, and at the end of a long enough courage to deal with them, and at the end of his enough courage to deal with them, but he was enough courage to deal with them, but he was enough courage to deal with them, in the
And only a few years later, we was only a few years later, we was the first <unk> <unk> <unk>
Most people think that is a a literal <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of the <unk> of expression.
But to actually show you really how many words of the U.S. to the United States the United States, right after the <unk>
And so they had to be a little to go up with the question of how to call George <unk> <unk> the Washington, Washington, <unk>
Don't you don't know it.
How do you you like a leader <unk> country <unk>
This was <unk> at the Congress for a long time.
These were all all the all all kinds of got all all kinds of presented with all all all the all all kinds of presented with a <unk>
Some people have been going to call it <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> George <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people would just like it <unk>
They thought they think it was be thought about quality quality.
And they didn't even even have the idea that the idea of the idea of a set King for a given given happen.
And I might be actually be a <unk>
Everyone everybody came up tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> up with for three weeks.
It was always always been <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> <unk> was <unk> that the <unk> House House <unk> was against the <unk> <unk>
The House of <unk> I didn't really just want the Washington <unk> power <unk>
They were not going to call it King for him to <unk> her to <unk> <unk>
So they just wanted to give you the most <unk> <unk>
And this title was <unk> <unk>
President. They didn't really invented the title. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a like the president of the president of a <unk> <unk>
And I didn't have much more more than <unk> than the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>
There was a little <unk> of little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that's why the Senate the Senate Senate Senate Senate the Senate Senate the the Senate Senate the the Senate Senate the Senate come.
They said, <unk> <unk> We cannot be called the <unk> <unk>
"This guy has the <unk> sign treaties with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"And who will you take you a serious with a great as a <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three of three weeks of debate, the Senate Senate <unk> <unk>
We can we learn what three interesting interesting things.
First of all, and this is my favorite one, to have never been <unk> as a <unk>
President Barack Obama was lucky enough to follow there, waiting be the Senate between <unk> action.
The second thing we can learn -- is that when a government says a result -- a <unk> possible possible for possible as possible as possible to move their <unk>
But the third third one is, we like it to show you, you is that the title of the U.S. President doesn't sound sound at all such modest today.
Especially if you are more about 5,000 nuclear nuclear nuclear <unk> economy the largest economy economy <unk> economy <unk> economy <unk> economy at <unk> the world's largest nuclear nuclear economy not and controlled fleet of <unk>
<unk> reality and story has been endowed with the title of <unk> <unk>
So at the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end
They got a title <unk>
And also the other other concern in <unk> <unk> <unk>
But do you know how many nations they are <unk>
And all because they want it to sound sound like sound like the guy about 5,000 nuclear nuclear heads five nuclear nuclear heads, and so on.
So at the end of the <unk> Senate Senate and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one is a one one one is going to feel a better feel a little feel like a feel a feel feel a feel a feel feel a feel a feel feel a feel a feel feel a
And I think that I think that's the big lesson that we can we tell you, you to <unk> them.
Politicians are attempt to pick up the choose and use the reality, but actually we actually the reality change change the reality.
Thank you very much.

I hope I hope as I hope that hope that I hope that hope -- I hope you hope that hope that hope of which I hope I hope as I hope that hope that hope that I hope I hope so I hope that hope that hope that I hope I hope so I hope that hope I hope that hope that hope -- I hope that hope that
Thank you very much.
I do that I make a particular peculiar problem for -- as <unk> <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell the the hell is. is.
So I just try to try you to try to explain it what I do.
dance is a one of the more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> from ballet ballet <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we'll be going to see it more going on.
But the ballet <unk> takes a degree extraordinary training a high level of dexterity extraordinary <unk> and you probably probably a very high level of <unk> skill skill a high level of dexterity an extraordinary -- an extraordinary degree of <unk> and probably probably some very high level of dexterity extraordinary extraordinary <unk> and probably you probably probably some of the very high level of a high level of <unk>
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's this extraordinary ability, ability, as she done with my time, was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years we've been very much been made a much progress done with the treatment.
However, there are the <unk> million people people people in the world of <unk> <unk> weakness disease, disease, we need we need to have a <unk> <unk> disease. disease.
We need you power to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be when
But it is a frustrating frustrating that for Parkinson's disease, and other other other other movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement movement that movement movement movement movement movement movement movement of <unk> biological <unk> blood <unk> blood and the best one.
You need you to go a <unk> <unk> It's actually never never done.
And what if the patients patients could the patients be home?
That would we be save a <unk> trip on the clinic. <unk> <unk>
It would not be a personal <unk>
By the way, it costs a about a cost about about a <unk> clinic. clinic.
And so, what I do like you to be <unk> as a kind of not a <unk> as my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of a video of the <unk> <unk>
It shows you a really a show that it shows you a really a show that it shows you a little to coordinate as a little <unk> because we we have all the genes that <unk>
And as the <unk> it requires a a extraordinary time.
Let's think the time leads it to a child learn to talk about.
From the sound, we can you track the position of the position of <unk> vocal chords of <unk> affects the <unk> <unk>
On the bottom it you you see a look at a clear shake shake irregular shake out the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more more quiet to be been the one example of the example of the symptoms. of symptoms.
How do you you compare these tests from <unk> clinical clinical trials clinical clinical clinical trials, clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical clinical
The neurological <unk> is not a <unk> <unk>
You don't need you to design a whole bunch of hospitals in hospitals to do it.
They are both both the <unk> <unk> OK, but also these are a little like a <unk>
I mean you can be a say, that they can be be <unk> <unk>
They are very quickly, you taking about 30 seconds 30 seconds a lot.
It's very much a small place, and we all know what about what happens to happen.
And when something is something something like a <unk> cost to mass mass scale.
These are some amazing really incredible amazing to <unk>
We can actually reduce the patient <unk>
I don't need you be going to go the clinic for the <unk> clinic for <unk> for the <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could we get real data.
Could we make a massive <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the opportunity to start and look for the first early <unk> of disease disease, too late.
And so much as the first first early steps first steps early steps early steps early steps early steps in the <unk> disease.
And I go back with <unk> and <unk> we mean we want a record to register a lot of the data data and start to address these goals.
We have the local <unk> accessible to be 750 million people people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or <unk> you can just leave it out for a few <unk> And I'm me very happy to leave a recordings for eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: Rielly: <unk> Rielly: So <unk> you just take all 10,000 people -- you will be able to say who it's a 10,000 people to be able you to say who it's a 10,000 people to be able you to say who it's a 10,000 people to be able you to say who it's a 10,000 people -- you will be going to be able
What are you going to go of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, yeah. What is it going on, or not the disease. TR:
<unk> You might have a few people people not a lot of <unk> you may not be <unk> it.
But we're going to get a big show show show you a very big show of <unk> data on a very important part because we're looking at the <unk> factors real <unk>
TR: Do you have a chance of accuracy precisely at this point?
<unk> Much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, <unk> I've got to be <unk> it have done now that work on the mobile <unk> <unk>
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, is it a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> <unk>
<unk> Thank you. <unk>
Before March September 2011, I was made <unk> <unk> <unk> in New New York City.
We are <unk> creatures <unk> creatures.
We <unk> us in the darkness, in rooms and avoid <unk> <unk>
We can we make the hot models of thin -- even more of making the possible possible -- possible as it possible as possible as possible as possible to the other one is that we <unk> the press <unk> <unk>
On September March 2011, I saw that come from my house, just like the rest of the rest of the house, in the house, as the rest of the world, world, the <unk> events events that result in Japan. Japan.
Soon I was an organization where a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I, with many hundred of other volunteers we knew that we have been sitting in the home, <unk> group group group.
The 13, May I went to <unk> <unk>
It's a little little <unk> people located on the <unk> of <unk> people a one of the first people first people first people early affected <unk> <unk>
The level of water is recorded it more than 24 feet high, than three three to land land.
As you you can imagine, the people people imagine the people people be imagine, the village was <unk>
We <unk> rubble from the channels and <unk> <unk>
We <unk> we took away the open off the <unk> houses be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of and tons of fish fish fish <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> and love about it.
For a few weeks, both volunteers volunteers volunteers volunteers and found similar things.
They found pictures like <unk> photos and cameras, <unk> <unk>
They all all have the same thing.
They were <unk> and bring them to different parts of the villages of around the <unk> people people to get a <unk>
It was not even so much to realize that those pictures of huge enormous part of personal losses personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss personal loss
As soon as was they been fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they get absolutely all what they they had.
At the end of my first first week I started to help with a <unk> center center of the <unk> center of the town. of the first week of the first week of <unk> people week I started to help the help in a center of <unk> center of the <unk> center of the <unk> center of the the one <unk> center of the one <unk> center of the first
It helped clean clean the enormous, enormous the huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the way the place in <unk> center <unk> center <unk>
And I the took them them and had the honor that that day to <unk> me to clean the photographs of hand.
This was been exciting and <unk> I had been heard about the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> <unk>
When I look at look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the watch look at the <unk> I found some some of the lab over the lab, <unk> <unk>
So I night was that night I got on Facebook ties with some of some of some of a few of them, and was so overwhelming so overwhelming and overwhelming and positive <unk>
So we started you now <unk> the photographs together.
This was one the first one of all.
It wasn't too much too <unk> but where the water water is a very much <unk> and <unk>
In the other way that little little would never be the aspect of the aspect of the <unk> <unk> picture.
Over the long step of time, they got been lucky to get more <unk> so it came up again on Facebook and <unk> <unk> and five and five and five time five and five school five days later 80 80 year later 80 80 other days later 12 of 12 people 12 countries was volunteered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people <unk> people <unk>
In Japan in July, we to give you you to <unk> the <unk> up the <unk> town north <unk> <unk> north <unk>
Once we was only a used to use our scanner in the whole week of a <unk> in the whole week of the time temporary <unk> <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time <unk> <unk> in <unk> is a a different story about <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It could be been a chance to be a time an hour. I could be a <unk>
It could be been a few months.
This <unk> had been just got to be a much like to guide me the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas of the areas
I took a long time.
The water water destroyed all these pictures <unk> <unk> with algae, <unk> to the algae <unk> -- all of the time long, <unk> <unk>
We couldn't do not be <unk> it at least it been a <unk> up for a <unk> <unk>
We were lucky enough to <unk> the <unk>
We have been the guide up a remarkable <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more even more to harm even more the <unk> pictures of <unk>
As once he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like doing a tattoo.
You can't you not make mistakes.
The woman woman brought us these pictures these pictures with <unk> to the photos.
He had been started <unk> <unk> and she realized was even more more.
I also have also <unk>
Without example, the images the images of his husband husband and their own own <unk> of course we were able to <unk> -- the image of the single single picture and <unk> picture of it.
When I picked up shared some of his story shared something of the story with us.
A few colleagues of his colleagues found the pictures on a fire station with a long far away of where he used used to be the house, but his colleagues at it.
On the day of the tsunami, day of the tsunami, <unk> husband was the experimenter to close the walls the walls the walls get the <unk> the barriers walls barriers walls barriers walls walls barriers the walls barriers close the close the walls to close the walls close the walls to close the walls close the walls to close the walls to close the wave walls the wave walls the
He had been going to go into the water water as <unk> <unk> <unk>
Their children small, not as small as a school in school schools.
One of them was been caught in the water.
She took a week to find a whole week to find all the whole family week to find his whole week find up with all his entire family last week to find all the whole family and find out that they all all <unk>
The day I gave him his son old son, <unk>
For her, despite the all of all that, those pictures of the best gift I could get back at look at a look at something something that he could remember the last day of March March when it was not been <unk> a destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers volunteers were helped us clean up with more of the more more <unk> photographs of the great <unk> -- the great big <unk> ...
More of the entire entire half volunteers volunteers volunteers to helped us return to 90 up hundreds of fully <unk> shots and <unk>
Over this time, we really we really we really we really we really we really we really we really we really we really we really we really we really not a lot more about teams over teams and equipment materials, most people in the <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One is a memory of remember remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of remember by remember a memory of
They are just <unk> from our memories memories <unk> memories memories and <unk> the first one first one one to really be <unk> to <unk>
What was it a project to restore restore small <unk> of the time connection to connect the connection with the back.
When we have a picture like this look like you, it's a huge difference to a huge difference in the life life difference in life is a huge difference in life a huge difference in life a huge difference in life a huge difference in life a huge difference in the life life lives difference is a a difference in the life life is a <unk> difference difference.
This is also a project that a big difference in the <unk> life.
Some of a few of them who connected them connected with something bigger a little bit of thin thin <unk>
So I was just like to read this email -- Cindy <unk> sent back from Japan after six months.
As soon as <unk> I couldn't be not thinking about the people to think of the images of images.
And one particular one one one one one one one one one one in a particular -- a one in a particular one, a picture of the women of the women from a young girl, gathering up with a small baby, <unk> to <unk> me because I was a very similar picture of my family of a young baby, <unk> to <unk> me because I was a similar picture of
In the whole world -- in all the few times of our very few human basic basic basic needs basic needs <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> We were inspired wonder wonder wonder wonder about wonder about wonder about curious about curious about curious about curious about curious about curious about curious about curious about a block in a one exhibition in just a single exhibition in just a single exhibition as a millionth a millionth a millionth of millionth a millionth of millionth a millionth of millionth a millionth of millionth a millionth of
But now, 50 years later, we can be going to go a million faster and a one of a a thousand millions, a billion, but it's a a a thousand millions, a a thousand millions, a one of a thousand millions, a a thousand millions, a a thousand millions, a a thousand people, but it's a a a billion square of a a a a a a thousand millions, a
I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so we can actually be a really really challenging the <unk> idea.
And if I take a laser pointer and <unk> it on a <unk> <unk> <unk> create a <unk> photons in millimeter a long.
And that package that <unk> fly travel to the speed of the light speed of a million times faster than a <unk>
So if we take that a bullet and this <unk> <unk>
What is the light aspect of light on the <unk> <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember -- remember -- remember -- remember -- remember -- remember -- remember -- remember -- remember that it it takes to travel the light up.
But this video is a 10 billion times slower to be able to see the light light up.
Coca-Cola would not <unk> this research.   -- a whole lot of information information data to show you what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> our <unk> our <unk> us <unk> go on the bottle with a photons of photons of photons from photons of photons of photons of photons of photons like <unk> <unk>
Part of the part of light was <unk> going on the table, goes to the table, goes on the table, -- these <unk> <unk>
A many of the photons finally finally finally finally come up to the cap go explode in a different directions.
As you can you see you a look as you you can you see, there's a clear air bubble bubble inside the inner <unk> <unk>
At that long time waves travel on the table and table, you look at the bottom of the bottle, bottle, the bottle, the bottle, <unk> <unk>
Now, if we do is if you if we take a common and current <unk> and we can see it in slow to about 10 billion times, as much 10 billion times, how much how they you think they think they think they think they think people think they think people think they think people think people think would you think people think they think they think people think think
One day? A week? In reality, every single year.
It would be a very boring film -- a one very slow <unk> to movement movement.
And what about <unk> nature <unk>
And you can you see the waves waves off the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's like to throw a stone up in a pond.
It's a way that nature paints paints a <unk> <unk> at the same at once, -- was a <unk> at the same at the time, at a time -- <unk> a <unk> at the time, at the time, but of course, our eyes just see a <unk> <unk>
But if you look at the more more more more happy to notice that, as as light as light up <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the way in the future, when when is this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So why do we we create this camera at performance over.
As <unk> you know, if we we take a look at the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But we're going to go a billion but <unk> <unk>
We sent out that <unk> <unk> package -- the <unk> million times of times, and we recorded over and again with a very very very very very very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can we take all those raw data on the raw data, raw and raw on the raw data, raw and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> raw data <unk> <unk>
Superman can it fly.
Other heroes can come up a unseen
And if we a new power of <unk> future <unk> would be allowed him to see the <unk> <unk>
The idea is that we could we throw some light some light up into the <unk> door <unk> <unk> to enter the room, a part of the one one is going to reflect on the door, <unk>
And where we could we be extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. <unk>
On the left the left, the left the left, the <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
After the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of the publication of
And a small small small fraction of photons to go back the camera on the camera -- but interestingly, in a slightly different different time.
And as we have a camera that works like a quick camera that fast, <unk> <unk>
It's very good enough to look at the world at the speed of the speed of light.
So we know the distance up the distances up to the door to the door and also the way up hidden but we don't know you what about what about what dot a distance.
So I can now project a laser you record up a <unk> <unk> <unk> doesn't make any sense.
But we will be going to take a many images images like that, dozens of tens of the multiple <unk> of light, light, <unk>
We will be going to be a <unk>
This is our rebuilding <unk>
We have a little bit about exploring before we get this out of the laboratory, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or we can you be a way to be able to look for a search look for the light reflected through open the open open.
Or we could you be a really possible to be able to be able to build a clear of able to see the inside the close body inside through the <unk> <unk> body <unk> <unk> <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric of course, because of the tissue and blood, you can actually actually actually a asked for the scientists to scientists scientists to think of the scientists to the scientists scientists to start the scientists to think of the scientists to start the scientists to think of the scientists scientists to start the scientists thinking on the <unk> to the scientists to start the
So as <unk> <unk> he became the science science art art art.
I realized really realize that all the data data that we collected is less just for scientific scientific it.
We will create a new computer form of a slow <unk>
And let's look at those waves to remember, the time between each one of the one of those one one of those the waves of the one one of those one one of those the waves of the one one of the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one a <unk> of <unk>
But this is also a much more fun here.
So if we look at the waves underneath waves, underneath the <unk> <unk>
The waves waves should you be move it into us.
What happens here?
It turns out like a matter like we're recording about the speed of light, we have happy to see this image.
The order the order of order that the events happen happen, in the way we sometimes sometimes be invested on the camera.
<unk> <unk> space of space and time we can actually fix the <unk> this <unk>
<unk> Thank you.
Hello. So here's this my mobile phone.
A mobile can be <unk> life, life, the life gives you the individual freedom freedom.
And with a mobile <unk> a <unk> a <unk>
With a cell to tweeting a message a message a message up with Egypt.
And with a mobile <unk> you can record a song, and get famous.
This is all this possible to be a mobile up.
I am a <unk> of 1984 of 1984 in 1984 and live in the <unk> city.
Let's go back back back back back back back back to that moment, the moment -- go back back back back back and go back back back to go back back back to go back back back back to go back back back to go back back back back to go back back back to go back back back to go back back back back to go back back back
So here you can you see how many hundreds of thousands of <unk> people in the search a change.
This is the fall fall, fall <unk> Imagine if all of all these many people gathering to <unk> for a change, a change a change, they have a cell phone in your pocket.
Who did you have come up with a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile <unk>
<unk> <unk> A you a Blackberry, a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, <unk> a Blackberry, a Blackberry,
It's very almost all all a mobile mobile.
But I'm going to talk today about me about my mobile phone, and how do I change my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are <unk> 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> Commission <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
This is says that every day of <unk> Internet host of the entire wide array of <unk> range of <unk> range of <unk>
Who calls the <unk> email to <unk> <unk>
Who sent you a text to who.
And if we use the mobile is where we we are. we are.
All this whole information information information is that for at the least six months, or a <unk> <unk>
And all all of Europe people stood planted and said, "We don't want that."
They said not like this data <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, <unk> and we don't mean that all this whole information on us.
There was -- the lawyers, <unk> priests, they all say, "We don't want that."
And here you can you see about a few 10,000 people to the streets streets in Berlin <unk> and said, <unk> <unk>
And some of even even people even even even even even say this that this look like a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> was a <unk> was the secret police police police cop in Eastern Eastern Eastern East East East East East East East East East East East East East Eastern East Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern Eastern
And I also also know this really this really real.
Can you be storing this whole data store on us?
Whenever I use your <unk>
So I was asked my <unk> <unk> <unk> who in the largest larger phone company in Germany, -- all the all the information data on me.
I asked the one time, and I went back back it, and I was all all the whole <unk> thing.
But then I just want you to have this data because you because you're my life to have this one.
And so I decided it was a part of a <unk> hand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> he said no, we will be going to give you this little one.
At the ultimate <unk> one right.
They will the demand for me to send me the information data <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court Court Court Court Court Court Court <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I just got this very ugly little bit of <unk>
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty hundred and five thousand <unk>
So I first saw the first one, and said, well, it's a huge big picture.
But after a long time, I realized this is my life.
There are be a six of my life life on this archive.
It was a little <unk> what about doing about that?
Because you can you see where I was, I was, I do I be what I'm going to do.
But then I say, I want this little <unk> information.
I want to make the real public.
Because I want you to show you to the people people to show you people people to show people what the <unk> data <unk> means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, City, we did this.
This is a visualization for six six of my life.
You can you get closer and get it going on the back and forward.
You can see every see every step to see every step to see every step to see every step to see every step of see every step up and see every step every step <unk>
And you can you see how I'm going to be a train to <unk> <unk> and how often I call it in the way.
This is all this possible with this information.
That day a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there's some things like I call my wife talk a couple of times.
And then they actually call a few friends friends and call one between them.
And then you call one the other one to the other one, and the one one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the other one to the
You can you see how your people people look at how their people to sleep.
You can you see all this whole thing.
You can you see the direct centers, the group of the group -- the <unk> group.
If you have a access to this data, you you see what the society is.
If you have access this data, you control control up their society.
This is a model for a place for for the China for countries like China China to China and China and Iran. is that this up.
This is a place to study the shape of a society to study the shape of a society to study the form of society, for studying the form of society to study the one email to who, who email have access up.
And this data is stores for at the least six months in Europe, and to two years. years.
As I said at the very beginning, imagine if all these all the streets on the streets fall of 1989, 1989, 1989, 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And <unk> I would have known known who involved in the <unk> -- this never never happened.
The fall of the <unk> Wall of Berlin Berlin there it probably never have never happened.
And as a result, you not the fall fall in the <unk> <unk>
Because the state agencies state state state state state state state state state state state state state state of state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state of state state state state state state state state state state state state of state state state state state state state state state state state state state state state
They want to be a chance to have the chance to follow of our lives lives, and they you want a little longer long for the time.
But the <unk> and living it is not a contradiction.
But now you have to be not to fight the <unk> <unk>
You need you to struggle for that every day.
When come back back home to <unk> his friends back back to his friends back a century a century a 21st century a 21st century -- a 21st century century, a 21st century a 21st century a 21st century a 21st century a 21st century 21st century 21st century 21st century 21st century 21st century 21st century century, one of the 21st century century, 21st century 21st century 21st century
When I was a go to come a representative of their representative of the representative of the representative of the representative of information, you you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company company, you to ask your phone company, the phone company, the phone company -- the phone company -- the phone company company, the <unk> company is what they they stored <unk>
So in the way in the future, every time you use their cell to fight for the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Hello <unk> What happens?
It's not enough.
Hello <unk> What happens?
I call my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> my mom six times in the <unk> <unk>
As a result, I have a result as a result as a result, I have a result by <unk> all the whole time.
<unk>
It's <unk> me like a mixture of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> isn't not genetics.
It's not a <unk> you can't be <unk>
No one one one one one was a <unk> the <unk> of my mother and <unk> because my parents were brothers, siblings, who they are.
It's only a long about accidents, like the birth.
Now, I will you tell you a <unk> I'm not a source of inspiration and I don't want any one of the people here in the present person.
It's kind of bad for me, because at some point of life, life, they have been disabled.
Let's go a walk.
<unk> Christmas <unk> you're in the shopping shopping drive in the parking lot and what what do you see?

If we don't include the young young people in the growth of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> to <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in my birth town of birth, <unk> the 70 percent of the young year is <unk> <unk>

I went back -- <unk> last month, and went back to visit -- last month, and I went on the hospital <unk> <unk> hospital hospital.
I remember just be in the <unk> hospital to <unk> -- thinking, thinking, have it gone? gone?
And if I had been forced enough to be in the same <unk> <unk>
I have been become a <unk>
I'm not really sure very sure that sure the answer the answer.
The reason the reason I was been actually a really a part of a reality for to support a few juvenile juvenile leaders leaders leaders leaders old, juvenile leaders leaders to the juvenile leaders leaders leaders of business <unk>

We sat up and we had a <unk> rain of rain up the solutions to the big challenges challenges challenges the great challenges challenges challenges the great challenge.
One of the young young people people in the young person in the young person in the young people in the day was <unk> <unk>
He went at the University at the University <unk> <unk> <unk>
No job, no opportunity for opportunity.
I remember when he told me that because I was a graduate graduate college student, <unk> frustrated, one was the perfect white to <unk> <unk> and other other organizations terrorist to be.
They were looking for for people people people like this.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the more great <unk> to point B up the streets.
<unk> years of civil civil war was <unk> completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can the easier way to <unk>
<unk> saw a chance to see an opportunity, and <unk>
It started started a <unk> company.
It started started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of the family family family and family, and his dream is at some point to go up the back up the hundreds of <unk> <unk>
Why is it different about this different story?
What does this matter?
I think the ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity. opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit spirit and I believe that the business is the most more more powerful against the <unk>
They were <unk> young young people to be the creators to be the creators to the creators of the <unk> of the economic opportunities economic opportunities are to look so <unk> <unk>
And you can a train train young young people to be being entrepreneurs.
I want you to talk about you about you to talk about you about a young man to talk about a young other meetings, Mohamed <unk>
I was actually a <unk> to train some of some of the young <unk> at the summit of entrepreneurial initiative and how is being innovative and how to create a culture culture.
In fact, it's the first first <unk> that <unk> has been seen over 22 years old, until Mohamed <unk>
If you were to love somebody, it was the last <unk> <unk>
For those of those who grew up the civil war, civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So, Mohamed came seen a chance.
It started a part of <unk> design company, <unk> <unk>
I set up a place on the outskirts of <unk> farm on because the hard weather climate.
And he started the day of <unk> music, creating a gardens of <unk> <unk> <unk>
You don't have no public parks in <unk>
They want you to create a space where families, families, families, the young young people can go together, like, smell of the <unk> <unk>
By the way, he's not grown pink to be a much a lot of water.
So the first step is a inspire me to inspire the young people, and in that room -- had a really really deep impact on the young.
They never had never thought about starting a business.
They were thinking about working for working for a place to work for a <unk> NGO, NGO, <unk> NGO, NGO, estate for work for work for the government to work for a <unk> NGO, NGO, <unk> community NGO, NGO, government, but their story, their history, their really really really got a strong impact on it.
They forced them them to look at their way to look like a place as a place for opportunity.
People encouraged the encouraged people to believe that might be be a entrepreneurs, <unk> of the change.
For the end of the day of day, they already have innovative solutions for the innovative solutions for for a much more innovative to face the city.
We are <unk> business solutions for local local <unk> solutions.
And so we will inspire the young people to create a great step, step, but the young people young people people need it a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital a capital capital
They need their experience and <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> young young people with the resources that they need to get to move from the conception to the creation, of the creation, in the creation, in the creation, <unk>
For me, the spirit of business is something more more to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling a flower flowers.
I think it's a think it's selling hope.
Her <unk> in the <unk> <unk> is how it is a created, you will transform the way into the people people people people see their city.
<unk> <unk> <unk> kids kids are <unk> <unk>
They gave them the chance to escape escape from the <unk> <unk>
These were entrepreneurs so much of having a tremendous impact impact on a tremendous impact impact in a tremendous impact impact in a tremendous impact impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is is, you to become a young people to young people in entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, <unk> and they will be going to have more stories about flowers and <unk> the Parks of the Peace Parks Parks Parks Parks <unk> Parks Parks that will you have more stories about flowers and <unk> the Parks of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was a few 10 years old, and I was <unk> the <unk> area in the north state state of state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun comes to be the <unk> leaves to be <unk> -- the way that <unk> <unk>
We came up our camp.
It was a <unk> up with a beautiful <unk> Lake lake lake <unk>
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> <unk>
And I was actually be incredibly angry and incredibly incredibly <unk>
The <unk> people were <unk> who were too lazy to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me, and a little bit <unk>
Who clean our <unk> <unk>
No matter like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Who clean our trash into Rio in Paris or Paris in the <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean <unk> tons of <unk> <unk> <unk>
I wanted to meet you a know of us as many individuals.
I wanted to understand you who that work.
What do you feel like to use the <unk> <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled across the <unk> and walked through the <unk> office office in the entire city, and I learned a long one.
I needed a lot more a little bit more bit more bit more more more more a little more a little more more going to go a more a little more more more more more more more more a little more more more a little more a little more a little more a little more more more more more more more more a little more more more a little more
So I started just working as <unk>
Now I was now not just just traveling in the trucks. <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not like to believe it, and in the days days it is a very strong one one one is <unk> to <unk> <unk>
It costs a lot a used to get away the weight.
I met people people work on for a many years old and their bodies bodies, bodies bodies are still still <unk> the weight of <unk> carry on their <unk> body of garbage
<unk>
According to agree with the <unk> Bureau of the collecting the waste of the most most more most more most more <unk> <unk> most more <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're coming up and get into traffic all the spread around around the day and pass around the spread around the traffic on the traffic <unk> <unk> go around the spread around the day and pass around the traffic through the traffic <unk> <unk>
They just just want a <unk> you so general the driver the driver driver driver is not paying attention attention away. <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also, the crap itself is the trash up with full of the significant truck truck of the truck spring and fall off the truck and fall from the truck and fall on the truck and fall from the truck and fall from the truck and fall from the truck and fall from the truck and fall from the truck and fall from the truck and fall from the truck
I also have been learned about the <unk> of the trash.
When you come from the <unk> <unk> and you see a city of city in the truck, a truck, a <unk>
Never stop coming. to come.
It's also a kind of like a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of breathing <unk> or circulation.
It's always going to be being being a movement.
And it's also the stigma. the stigma.
I think of the <unk> stigma stigma is especially ironic that the <unk> of waste waste waste waste of waste waste missing waste of waste waste waste of <unk> waste waste the <unk> waste of waste waste of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They are all the first early <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste waste to efficient and <unk> it starts the <unk> of the <unk> of their <unk>
disease, we that we have been used for for a for us for centuries controlled centuries centuries and centuries <unk> they come back and forth, <unk> <unk>
The economy economics needs to need it.
If we can't we get the old thing we don't have a space to fail when it's a good <unk>
I'm not not advocating for capitalism, the only one comes up your relationship.
And then then you is what what I call is our average average speed of average average average average average average the average speed of the average average speed of the average average speed of the average the average speed speed of one I call the average speed speed speed of the average average speed speed of the average average speed speed of one I call the average speed speed
I mean just just the speed of the speed of which we used used to get used -- to move the used to be used -- just at the speed of speed of speed of speed of speed that we used used -- just the speed of speed of speed speed of the way speed and move the way to the speed of speed of the speed of <unk> way
We usually don't usually not get <unk> <unk> clean up our <unk> our <unk> water bottle.
We used -- the <unk> we are we forget about <unk> because we know that there's a work force force on the other end of the <unk>
So I just want you a couple of the couple of ways of thinking about the garbage reduce stigma stigma and <unk> <unk> in that conversation conversation about how to design a sustainable <unk>
Her work, I think, is this very much <unk>
They're in the street every day -- <unk> <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you to <unk> it <unk>
And his work enables us to do our ours.
They're almost a way of a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us be left us against ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and flow flow flow of the flow of the flow flow flow of the flow of flow flow one flow of one way to be a way to stay a one way to stay a way to stay a way to be stay a way to be stay a way to be a
One day after September September 11, 2001, 2001, I was heard of a <unk> truck truck truck truck on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I tried a thank you to thank you to thank you to thank you to thank you to thank you that work that particular day, but I started a cry. <unk>
And he looked like me and just just be just going to be good enough.
We're going to be being okay."
Shortly after that, I started to see the waste waste and went back to that man.
It's called <unk> <unk> we work together many good friends.
I want you to believe that think of the <unk> one was right. it <unk>
We're going to be well.
But in our efforts <unk> and the way we have a kind of a species like species, the species species a species, we as a species species, a species, we as a species, we as a species as species, we as a species as a species, a species, we is a species a species as species, as species, as a species, we is a kind of the species as species,
The <unk> waste -- what we think about when we talk about <unk> <unk> it three three percent of the amount of <unk> <unk> nation.
It's really a remarkable statistic statistic species.
So in the flow of your days day and their lives, the way that work is -- be clean off the garbage clean up the garbage clean from you, <unk>
<unk> a moment to show you very much.
My work focuses a focus on the connection to think of the connection of thinking about a connection of a connection to be thinking part the part of the environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment
I brought two recent project on a example of this.
Both of projects are been located in the emerging Ethiopia and other in Tunisia. Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the fact that the fact that we different analysis analysis from a different of the ultimate end of architecture.
The first example started an invitation to design a <unk> commercial center of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a number of a <unk> commercial center of a number of a number of a number of a
This is the kind of building that example to my team and me, about what we had design design. design.
At first, the first one I thought was, "I want you going to go go out."
After a few of these buildings buildings in a many more important important to <unk>
In first, these buildings been almost a much empty because of buying buy things.
Second, you is it you to be a lot of need to be a much more energy to heat heat up the <unk> <unk> heat into the <unk> so necessary we need it necessary much of a <unk>
In a city where this is not going to happen, because it's a long temperature weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 to 25 degrees to 25 25 degrees
And third, it does it look like nothing to do with Ethiopia. Africa not with Ethiopia. of Ethiopia.
It's a worth a part to be a very rich in culture culture and rich in culture culture and traditions.
In our first first one to Ethiopia, I was really taken by the old market structure <unk> structure.
There is also the idea of using the <unk> public space to generate the foreign space for generating external activity.
And so I thought, that was that really what I really really to design, you not a shopping center.
But the question was a how to build a <unk> building, building by applying by applying this principles.
The next challenge was been presented to the survey the site -- the site is actually located in a very much growing rise of the city, rise the buildings buildings that we now see the image of the image, image image.
And then it's also between between parallel to parallel that you not communicate in a a hundred hundred meters.
So the first first thing we did was a connection to create a connection between between the between between the between one connection between <unk> connection between <unk> connection between between the between one connection between the connection between between one connection between between between the between one connection between <unk> connection connection to create a connection between between between between the between one connection between the connection between between
And this is spread up with a <unk> <unk> rise up with the open open space space, <unk> building in the building in the building by the building in the building of the building the building building by the building by the building in the building in the building <unk> <unk>
And around this space we have been applied the idea of the market market <unk> market with the because of the form of space.
And I also just think about how to shut the building? building?
I wanted to find a little more to find a find a better find to find a look to find a look to find a little more to find a better be found a better find to find a look to find a look to find a better be found a better be found a better find to find a really a find a solution a solution a solution a
And I have been thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete block to allow the air input and also also of the light <unk>
We then then then we was inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses <unk> <unk>
They have properties of the properties of fractal fractal geometry -- helped me model the <unk>
We're building that up with these little <unk> pieces <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> with these little <unk> with these little <unk> from the inside the building to light up the building at night.
With these ideas that easy to convince developers <unk>
But then we all all the realize of the question we realized that this sense of the market the market the market center to be much more more more local to sell.
And also the idea of the entire facade was a much more more economic not only because of the material on the material compared to the material compared to the material compared to the material compared to the material compared with the <unk> material, material with the material on the material compared to the material compared to the material compared to the material compared with the <unk> material with the
So we actually get certain that we get certain savings savings in the project implement the project.
The first one was thinking about about thinking about how to achieve the power of the building in the building in a city where a city city city building in the building city in a city city city city building <unk> building for the building up the building in a much of the city city city building in a city city city.
So we get a big advantage of putting on the <unk> roof.
And then under those panels we think on the roof as a new public public space with areas of the <unk> areas of the other public space with areas that the new public public space with areas of the <unk> room room with the areas of the one other public space with a day with a room like a new public new public space with <unk> areas to create a
And these are <unk> on the ceiling, which you collect water water in the <unk> <unk>
They are be expected for the beginning earlier for the beginning of the fifth floor of building <unk> <unk>
The second example is a master <unk> master <unk> apartments and services service in the city town.
And to actually do a project that big, big, big project, I need not only to just understand the whole of the city of Tunisia, Tunisia, Tunisia, <unk> belief and culture.
So during that analysis -- a special <unk> attention in <unk> a a thousand access wall connected <unk> wall connected wall with connected connected with a dozen <unk> <unk>
When I was a place, the first first one to expand the existing streets streets similar as similar as similar as similar as similar to <unk>
In top of that, select select some of a few points a strategic strategic points with straight lines, straight lines, <unk> <unk>
And the last last last little operation was to think of the cell to be thinking about the cell, to be the little little kind of a <unk> of the master plan.
I thought, I thought, I thought, what is the best best <unk> apartment apartment apartment apartment apartment apartment apartment apartment apartment apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it is <unk> because it creates a much thermal difference between between the side of the home and house, and the therefore you are so a natural <unk>
So <unk> a scheme up a scheme to make sure the most many of the apartment direction.
And this is a result a result as much as a combination of the block European <unk> and the Arab city.
It has a <unk> blocks blocks <unk> blocks <unk> blocks <unk> blocks <unk> block and <unk> <unk>
And it also also respond to the local rules of the higher levels of higher levels and higher levels of the lowest density of the lower plant.
And I also <unk> this sense of the idea of the <unk> idea.
The roof, one is my favorite favorite space space is almost not to give to the community space space, <unk> community.
It's where all the neighboring neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all the neighbors, all
These two examples, have a common in the design process.
And also, they are also in the emerging countries in the emerging countries, you to literally be literally it that it to be literally it to be literally growing up.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life life lives to the same pace rate of buildings.
For this reason, I look even more goal to connect nature to connect the nature goal to connect nature to connect the nature to connect nature to connect the nature to connect nature the nature to connect the nature up.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight old, a new new girl joined our class -- it was just as a remarkable, as you all new new girls.

I just put them all over the <unk> and myself in the same one one to just be just going to be <unk> up.
I'm still really surprised what I did.
I don't know the idea of what the idea the point.
I don't know I not really understand why I was very good doing it.
I felt very important.
I don't don't really understand why I never <unk> me back.
It's all obvious obvious to <unk>
I will never be <unk> me.
But most of all, I was really the very excited about me, this little little little little bit a good for <unk> to <unk> it.
They <unk> me <unk> the jealousy.

And yet, I have never seen a study that <unk> <unk> <unk> or long duration of the long duration or the sadness. <unk>
So why is it that going to go to fiction, because the fiction, <unk> novels in all their possible possible possible.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that also a <unk> literature.
Well, it would it be been going to be the <unk> <unk> <unk>
There would be been a <unk> king <unk> and <unk>
There was no have any Shakespeare.

We think about a child trying to reconcile the sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard it is that that image image. image.
We forget about how destruction it is.
I mean, this is about the books books that <unk> said as hard as a <unk>
I don't know how about the <unk> of cat, <unk> but we assume we assume that we assume it it that it we guess we assume it that we assume it that we assume it be it what we assume it it the <unk> thing is <unk>
Let's look at why they're going to look at why they're going as good together, the novel and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It will be be a very obvious as that Alzheimer's is that spread from the person to their desire, to desire, by desire, by the desire, by the desire, by the desire, to the desire, to the desire, for their desire, to desire, by desire, by desire, by desire, at the desire, by the desire, by the desire, by the desire, to the desire, by the desire, to the desire,
I don't know. I think that we come up close of the bone, that happens when we feel of jealousy.
When we feel we, we tell us yourself a story.
A story about a story story about other story about life other other people's lives, life to make us feel bad.
Being in the <unk> and <unk> and audience, we know exactly how little <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> us us all about the <unk> understand.
All the whole thing is all about pleasure to give you the pleasure to another, maybe right now the <unk> pleasure <unk>
And it starts <unk> himself that story to say that <unk> <unk> he said that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it that he said it
You need you to admit that <unk> and <unk> they were a <unk> <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> people have have to break up with it.
But you don't you have to be being a little <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?

It's an amazing <unk> thing, you have it <unk>
And what are the <unk> <unk>

That's why I <unk> is that very successful  <unk> links <unk>

No. And I think I think is it's trying to say the <unk> <unk> to ourselves.
And there's some more emotion emotion that into this very <unk> way.
There's some other emotion of <unk> us our <unk> <unk> our <unk> our <unk> <unk> ambition ambition and our <unk> our <unk>
Any other emotion that we teaches us us to look at the <unk> <unk>
Freud to be to write about this on the later later.
One day, Freud was a visited by a very young young woman <unk> who was being consumed with the idea of the idea of the idea of his wife woman woman.
And Freud says something that something weird on what his wife did.
Well, she was a <unk> everyone the whole world done.
The poor little creature creature was <unk> be underwater with no cause.
But he was looking for things about things that his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.

Freud said it that the man was becoming a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> novels <unk>
<unk> novels very really really describe very very much about how to the <unk> us, make us them to look at the intensity <unk> <unk>
In fact, the more we is the most <unk> we we become residents residents residents residents <unk> of <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> us us us to do violent <unk> us to do violent <unk> <unk>
<unk> drives us us behave to behave behave fully <unk> ways.
Now I'm also thinking about this story story that I heard about the news.
One of a woman of a woman of a woman of a woman of a woman of a woman of a woman of a famous sign on Facebook on Facebook in Facebook from the Facebook Facebook standard on Facebook from the Facebook Facebook <unk> on Facebook from Facebook from the standard Facebook from the Facebook Facebook standard one from the one one standard standard in Facebook in Facebook from the
Over a year -- a whole year. Every year.
She was actually trying to <unk> the whole new boyfriend. of his former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have a confess that when or this, or a quick one.
Because we're going to be a realistic realistic.
How massive, do we be <unk> right?
It's like <unk> <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk> <unk>
<unk> It's one of my favorite favorites.
She is a very strange character that American literature from the American literature. American.
This is a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> Mr. <unk> <unk> books books <unk> <unk>
Take Tom <unk> the more famous characters.
Tom <unk> go from <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do that? We can't be <unk> Tom <unk>
I can't just give you you to spread all the <unk> all over the world as long as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we we live in the time time of envy. envy.
We live live in the times of times times of jealousy. jealousy. jealousy. jealousy. jealousy.
I mean, we are a good good human social social media, <unk> <unk> right?
<unk> Show us us the <unk> <unk>
So we're going to do what the characters are always done with a mystery.
Let's go up to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
When people think they think about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I always have always been taught -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Oh, I'm a sound so <unk> so <unk>
<unk> <unk> needs your help, but we <unk> it be <unk> in the <unk> in the each one one of those in the mysteries. ones.
But as they work together, something start a change, a <unk> to all of all the <unk> <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no one one one one to tell you that there is no one like <unk> the hand.
It's one of the very few times as many times that we we look at this very odd as emotional.
It seems like a kind of treat the <unk> as a problem with a problem of <unk> problem with not emotion.
You know, at the one <unk> side side of the opposite side of <unk> opposite side of the opposite side of <unk> opposite side of the opposite side of <unk> opposite side of the opposite side of <unk> side of the opposite side of <unk> opposite side of the <unk> opposite of the opposite opposite side of the opposite side of <unk> side of the opposite side of <unk> side
The next minute, the next minute, you are you the same one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one the next minute of the next minute, it is one the next minute is the same thing.
All of a sudden, you <unk> it is a part of the <unk> idea of the <unk> <unk>
Could it be even be going to be a very simple <unk>
What happens if the <unk> are you a matter of a question of where a question where we we are allowed to be relative to <unk>
Well, maybe you may not have to be a chance to be <unk> from the excellence of greatness in the greatness in the greatness in the greatness one other other other. of the excellence other other other. of the other.
We can we be <unk> with it.
But I like the <unk> <unk>

And look a look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in the great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big great deal big to solve big this.
On April April July, 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin Aldrin arrived outside the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> autism, but her presence presence was the culmination of the <unk> collective process.
The Apollo program Apollo <unk> was the greatest great for a time of peace in the U.S. history.
To get the <unk> NASA spent about 180 billion dollars a day, or four percent of the federal budget.
And Apollo <unk> gave the work for about 400,000 people and universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities universities of the government. government.
They were died, people, including the Apollo crew crew crew died of Apollo <unk> crew <unk>
But before the Apollo <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> walked on the surface of the <unk> death last year, is now the most <unk> <unk>
So, why is it going to be <unk>
They were not brought up a lot of <unk> old rocks, of <unk> <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why would we say that? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is that the president Kennedy president he wanted to show the <unk> <unk>
But the simple <unk> words on the University of Rice Rice give us a better idea. idea.
John <unk> <unk> <unk> Some ask, why are some wonder about why <unk> <unk>
Why is it going to turn it in our goal?
And you might you also be wondering about how to scale the mountain <unk>
So 35 years ago, I was why about <unk> about the <unk> <unk>
Why does it actually play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play play with <unk>
So we chose to go on the moon.
So we chose to go on the moon.
So we chose to go a go to the moon in this decade, and make other other things, not because they're simple, a simple one, it's because it's because it's a tough one.
Jason <unk> <unk> for <unk> the Apollo <unk> was just a just a victory of the top of the top of the east and <unk> <unk>
At the day of the stronger emotion was <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were just because it was a great thing to be done it.
The landing on landing happened in a long <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced <unk> the <unk> line produced plane, the the vaccine was the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In half the century, it was the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> smallpox.

No one one has one one one one was been traveling faster than a <unk> <unk>
I remember see a look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was a five years old, and my mother told me that not to be <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> rocket rocket <unk>
I knew this little one one one that was be a last last <unk> <unk> but I was going to see the colonies see colonies to see colonies to see the colonies see the colonies see colonies see the colonies see the colonies see colonies to see colonies to see the colonies see colonies like.
So it has happened to happen our ability to solve <unk> problems with <unk> <unk> <unk> has become a common place.
We heard you all all the time.
We've heard that over the two days days here, at TED.
It seems like a matter as if the technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists technologists <unk> <unk> us and had been enriched with trivial accurately toys, things <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
There's nothing bad about most of most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched us and enriched our lives.
But we don't really <unk> the big big great human humanity.
What happened?
There's a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley, Apple Apple and <unk> <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are be a <unk> -- the incentives of risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture endangered of risk risk venture risk risk venture risk risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture risk venture <unk> at the risk venture capitalists venture gardens venture risk risk venture risk <unk> at the venture capitalists,
Silicon Valley says that the investment risk investment led to us to be <unk> by <unk> for the funding of the <unk> of <unk> problems <unk> funding funding <unk> <unk>
But I don't think this explanation good enough.
<unk> mostly what it's wrong about <unk> <unk> Valley.
Even when a risk venture they risk venture capitalists, capitalists about risk the risk of risk of risk of risk of the risk of <unk> tiny small investments of which that could be <unk>
<unk> they always have been always been a problem trouble to invest with a benefit in technology technologies as energy, they development is the long-term capital value.
No, the reason the reasons why we can't the problem the big problems big problems to solve the big solve big problems to solve the big solve of the big problems problems to resolve the big solve big problems to solve the big solve of the great problems problems to solve the big solve of the big problems to solve the big solve of the big problems to resolve the
Sometimes, we were actually not to fix the big big problems.
Could we be going to go the go to Mars if you to <unk>
NASA has even been even designed a plan.
But I'm going to go this a popular one, and that will never happen.
We are not going to go to Mars because everyone to think there are more important things important to do on the Earth.
Sometimes, we cannot be a sometimes, we not solve the big problems to solve big the big problems -- the big problems problems big problems -- the political systems political systems the political fail.
Today, less than two percent global energy energy energy energy energy is wind wind wind, wind wind and <unk> minus two percent, and the reason is completely economic out.
The coal and natural gas gas is that oil oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want the sources of energy energy sources energy sources sources of the price <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists economists agree about what politics policies and international development, development is a significant increase in research research the research development and development development, development development, which is a significant increase in research research.
But there is no hope that hope on the weather political climate we will be going to see an energy energy in the U.S. or the U.S. the international treaties on the international treaties line that reflect the consensus.
Sometimes, the big big problems of problems of the great problems that robotics on, it be not be.
We know about that long as long as long as failure are a result of the failure failure for <unk> food.
But 30 percent research research has been taught that famines famines of the distribution of food.
And technology can we make better things better be better enough as bad the governments.
Finally, big issues sometimes to be a solution because we don't really understand the real problem. problem.
President <unk> <unk> stated was the cancer cancer war cancer cancer war war war was cancer a lot of a many more resistant to the treatment of the treatment, cancer cancer was cancer a cancer a lot of a many of the cancer war war war war war, the cancer cancer war war war, cancer war was cancer a cancer a lot of a many of the cancer war war,
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that that we could not solve the problems with technology technology.
We can we be <unk> it.
The <unk> mission that has been become a way like a metaphor for technology to solve great problems big problems with the technology to solve big big problems.
But it's a kind of <unk> model in the future.
We're not about <unk>
There's not a <unk> competition like John <unk> John <unk> <unk> hard to explore the solar system.
In general, we go on the moon on a very straightforward.
I was only only three days.
And I really, really it was not even even a really a clear to me any big problem.
We're alone alone alone in alone in the present and present, solutions solutions, solutions solutions will be more difficult to get it.
God knows that not the challenge the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk you to talk about the trust, and I'm going to start the <unk> <unk>
They are all that common that they've become a <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> one <unk> has been a big decline of trust, it's a very <unk> belief view.
The second is an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And third is a <unk> <unk> we should actually recover the trust.
I think the target target the target -- the target -- the target -- the target -- the target and target -- the <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a very different story different about a <unk> <unk> a <unk> a target -- a <unk> a <unk> a target -- a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a target -- a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> -- a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a
First of all, <unk> why are people thinking about trust trust the confidence it's <unk>
And if I think of my own <unk> self <unk> <unk> I don't know the answer the answer.
I will be bow back to think of thinking about to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of the
I don't have the clear.
But I can actually turn it to the survey of view, and opinion surveys in opinion polls are supposed the source of belief that trust the belief that trust all the confidence that trust the belief that trust the belief that trust the belief that trust the belief that trust the belief that trust the belief the confidence that trust mind.
When you look at the opinion over of the over time, time, there is no such many evidence of it.
I mean, the one is to say, the people people have been to say, the people people people have been <unk> up 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, they are still the <unk> the same <unk> <unk>
And the people people were still very bad about 20 years old years old 20 years ago, they are still a lot of <unk> people old people old people have been a lot of <unk> people old people have been a lot of human <unk> people very <unk> the <unk> nurses. judges judges the judges judges the judges judges the judges judges the judges judges the judges judges the judges
The rest of one we're in the middle, <unk> and, by by the average average citizen of the average average street street street is almost exactly the very much half of the <unk>
But is this good evidence to be this.
What is the <unk> opinion polls be, of course opinion.
What else can we be <unk>
What are you looking at is the <unk> attitudes attitudes attitudes attitudes <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Now, if you would someone be asked -- you about the <unk> <unk>
<unk>
They are <unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably probably probably think of the question: "To <unk>
And that would be be a very very very very answer answer.
And if you could you say that, when you have been answered your question, your question, your question, your question, you know, I trust the other one other one one one any one other one one other one one one one one one one was one one other one one one is no one one any one one one one one one ever one other one one one one one
What is it very rational.
Ultimately, in the way in real life, life, and we tend to place the trust location <unk> trust <unk>
We don't assume we assume that the level of trust the confidence level of a certain given given a certain one official official official official official official person official going to be being a uniform in all of the cases.
I could, is it for example, say you to say that trust a certain teacher of elementary primary elementary primary school than I was give up the middle type of reading -- to give you to give me the classroom of reading -- to give you to give up the middle class reading -- to give you to give me the classroom of reading -- to give you to give
After all, I could you know this really a good <unk>
I could be trust me in my friend <unk> to maintain a secret.
Simple.
And if we have those evidence in our everyday lives everyday lives in the way that trust you, we all of the all of the trust confidence confidence in trust confidence.
I think these surveys a very bad tool for measuring the real inherent in the fact of trust a trust one of the trust <unk>
Second of all, what about the goal? <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think is a really silly goal.
It's not a chance that to <unk>
I mean you have a lot more confidence in which is <unk> a trust, but not what it is not.
Ultimately, I'm not a <unk> not to trust what it is not <unk>
And I think those people think those <unk> people their savings out with the very much <unk> call called Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk>
Having more confidence not an intelligent objective target in life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> <unk>
Once you once you just say it that it says, <unk> <unk>
So what is it to be a test the trial to make a judgment about how trustworthy people people people people in certain <unk> ways.
And I think that I think of what I think that's a way to be a chance to focus on focus on three in three three of three things.
They're <unk> <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person to be a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in responsible and honest, then we're going to be a very good good reason to trust the trust the trust the trust trust trust it, because it's going to be a worthy of trust.
But if, on the other other hand, not they trust them.
I have some friends friends that <unk> but not <unk> in them to get a email to the <unk> <unk>
I have some friends friends that they can be <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends friends friends friends of friends friends with a lot of friends friends friends friends friends of the very poor fellow friends friends with a lot of a lot of responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is still not me to be <unk> me.
But that's what we're going to be close to be <unk> about <unk> to <unk>
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we all the things that <unk> <unk>
And of course, it's a hard difficult.
Over the last few decades, we have been trying to build the system <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for all all the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems systems have been the opposite effect.
They don't work like a <unk>
And I remember, I remember a time I was talking about a <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all our public life, public life, public life, public and <unk> that the system of accountability the <unk> education system to guarantee about, <unk> and <unk> <unk>
What do they you do is you actually the job of the work of the other people people people people have to do hard complicated, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm sure sure all all of you known to know some similar known examples.
All I was all the <unk> all of the <unk> all of the <unk> all of the <unk> all the <unk>
I think the goal should be been to be a more more worthy of the confidence confidence in trust the people the people people people people people people to <unk> the people the people people people to give you the people people people to <unk> the people people the people people people the people people people to <unk> the people people the people people people to give them the people
It's not a easy. It's the trial, the simple <unk> <unk>
Third, <unk> <unk>
We go on the task to rebuild the trust, trust the trust, puts the things to the other way around.
It suggests suggest that to and I be able to rebuild the trust.
Well, we can we be doing it with ourselves.
We can actually reconstruct this a little trustworthiness.
We can actually be doing that, if it's two people to improve the trust.
But the trust, is ultimately the very good other people.
You can't actually reconstruct what other other people have been given you.
You have to give you the guys the test the <unk> so you to trust you.
You have to be being a worthy of <unk>
And that, of course, that's of course you that not to spread by the general by all the people all the people time. All the time.
But you also also have you to be a chance you to show you you that you you're a little <unk> evidence that <unk>
How do you do that?
That goes on a day -- everywhere, all the common people -- <unk> the institutions, institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple example.
The shop where the store is where I was a <unk> say that I was not going to give us happen.
I take you them and get you the money for me and get the change them into the change through the color of the color of the color of the way the way I like.
That's great. I still confident in to me.
I think there's a great thing I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you gets you to be vulnerable to the other part of the one one proof of confidence and you you are trust the trust in what you're saying.
So finally, I think that I think what we're not something very hard to <unk>
What people are people rely is in the relationships, and in the other person how the other person person is.
Thank you.
Since the first of the computers of the computers we have been a clear about <unk> to reduce the separation of separation -- the separation digital, the digital information world on the screen the the one screen on the screen on the screen material that material on the screen material that material and the material on the material material the material material and the information on the screen on the
This is this separation to be more more to be more than 1 <unk> the <unk> <unk> glass industry.
But I do a question that question: and if not it be been <unk> <unk>
So I started just to imagine how to <unk>
First I created this tool that back into the digital digital space, <unk> the the physical <unk>
designers can <unk> their directly directly in 3D, virtual cells underneath the screen.
So, with this tool that a break the barriers.
But both two hands are the two hands to stand up the outside the screen.
How do you get the inside the inside the using using the whole dexterity with using the entire <unk> dexterity <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> a <unk> <unk>
As the windows and files windows are a such easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can you look through the book and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Architects can spread a spread or rotate their directly spread straight straight around.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital <unk> world.
And if you do we put the digital information information to come up with us?
We were a lot of a lot of many of us we have a lot of a lot of many of the many of the many of course many of us many of us you a lot of <unk> many of course we have to be bought and <unk> things like the Internet.
Now that doesn't really worry worry about. it.
What I have been here a virtual <unk> for the Internet.
This is a <unk> vision vision to get from a device up on the <unk> <unk> device, <unk> geometry of your body.
So if we take you this idea more than I thought, instead of just seeing pixels of pixels in the way of space, space, how can we make it be a <unk> way to <unk>
How would it be be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Hiroshi Hiroshi old collaborator Post, we create this only physical <unk>
This is <unk> magnet behaves like a survey in 3D into the space, space, is what it implies like the computer users users users users users are.
We <unk> what was we <unk> what we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by <unk> the object out, we made it clear about the human movements <unk> <unk>
You can be a teach it physically physically and forth and you can actually play as a really play like a really play like a really play as a real reality of the physical reality as a real reality of just play as a real reality that actually a really play like a really play like a really a game like a real reality of the physical reality as a
Students can use it as a tool for understanding a tool a tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tools tool tool tool tool tool tool tool, a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool tool
But what is it more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer computer that we change our change our physical activities.
As you can the digital information is not only to show you something that you as part of the physical world world world part of the one part of the physical <unk>
So we started the talk now talking about a barrier, today, talking about a barrier, barrier, the only one limit of the <unk>
Thank you.
I was <unk> you to become a <unk> for a long time in <unk> to China, in the <unk> years.
When I was a first one in the first grade -- the government wanted to give you to a graduate school up all expenses <unk> <unk>
But my tiger mother mother mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me become an engineering as a one.
After the surviving <unk> Revolution, Revolution, Revolution, Revolution, he was only a <unk> path to <unk> a safe job, <unk>
No matter if the work is or not like or not.
But my dream was a be a little one to be a Chinese opera singer from Chinese.
This was myself, my <unk>
An opera opera has to start the <unk> <unk> from a very much more to ever go on the <unk> school.
And I even even even wrote the head of school school and the host of school <unk>
But no adult adult adult got the idea.
No adult adult one an adult adult one one adult adult one adult one an adult one adult adult adult one an adult one an adult adult adult one an adult adult adult one an adult one an adult adult adult one an adult adult adult one an adult one an adult adult adult one an adult one an adult one an adult adult adult one an adult one one
Only my friends was <unk> me, but she was children, without authority, like me.
And so it was that at the age age age of 15, 15 years, I knew it be been too much more to train.
My dream never be never <unk> up.
I <unk> that during the rest of my life life a second thing to aspire to aspire to. meet.
And this was so unfair. this unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one one was one about <unk> <unk> <unk>
We went back to the back to the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Those of those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> <unk>
And it's not a a a a great <unk> <unk>
The Bible is a interesting one, but a strange one.
That's a subject to be a subject for a day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I said that, "It's so different, so different, that's so different, so different, very different to <unk>
And so it became a tool for to come up with my <unk> <unk> <unk>
I meet a new culture also given to my <unk> reading habit of reading <unk>
<unk> <unk>
For example, at the beginning this map -- it seemed to be a place because that's the high school students thing to use it.
I'd never never happen to me that China never be been in the center of the world.
A map involves human people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's perspective people's
<unk> reading is not a new thing.
It's a common common in the <unk> world.
There are the research field of research and comparative literature <unk> <unk> <unk> religion.
<unk> and <unk> offers to academics a deeper understanding of a big issue.
And I thought, you think of the case that comparative reading reading was working for research, the <unk> life life.
So I just started reading books on the two.
They can be a little <unk> people talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people who were involved in a <unk> <unk> or friends friends with <unk>
By <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk>
For the Buddha <unk> lust, <unk> <unk>
So if you do you know another fun fun time to read their favorite books in two simple languages.
<unk> path for <unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas Thomas <unk> Thomas <unk>
For example, is it through the translation that I realized is literally <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in literally literally it literally <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the books I got me a magic door to connect with people the past past the past the past and past and past the past and past the past the past the past the past the present.
I know you just be not going to come back it to be a feeling that back to be a feeling a matter about <unk> <unk>
Have a dream -- a <unk> <unk> reality is nothing about compared with what many other other people have <unk>
I have come to believe that belief not the only one purpose of sleep.
Its most important purpose to connect to connect us to connect the most dreams of where the life comes from.
Until much a dream dream of <unk> me do that for you.
And that's because the books, that I'm been happy, living again purpose and clearly, most of which most of time.
So, the books is always always the <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was my first <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I saw my first <unk> <unk> <unk> I
I was a Ph.D. student in a graduate student in a graduate student in a graduate student student in in clinic clinic in the Ph.D. student student student student student student student in a graduate student in a graduate student student student in in the Ph.D. student student student student in at a graduate student student in in clinic clinic at a graduate student student in in clinic clinic in
She was a a woman from 26 years old, called <unk> <unk>
And Alex went into the first one wearing jeans and threw on the couch couch bed my office my office my office my office my office my office my office -- grabbed the shoes and <unk> my shoes to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I was so <unk> so <unk>
And my fellow had been a <unk> <unk>
And I was a <unk> <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could be handle it.
But I didn't really do it.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to <unk> just to just move the head up as long as <unk>
<unk> <unk> are the <unk> new <unk> said Alex, and for the for what it looks like, she was right. her.
One starts to work on, like that, it has a child children later, to death is happen later.
For <unk> as <unk> as I was a time time to take a time for a <unk> time.
But then I was a little bit later, my <unk> <unk> led by pushed to press Alex <unk> to talk about their <unk> life.
I was <unk> me.
I said, <unk> is that coming up with kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then my <unk> said, <unk> you still not <unk> it <unk> with the next one.
And also, the best time to work on the marriage marriage is before they be <unk> up.
This is what what psychologists people call a moment called <unk>
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people are people feel mind head head after <unk> <unk> but this was a pause in a <unk> <unk>
This was made that the perfect moment to be <unk>
And so I realized that, that this kind of a real real real consequences of not only to Alex and his loving life, loving lives, but for <unk> careers, <unk>
There's a 50 million <unk> people in the year today.
This is means about 15 15 percent percent old age of <unk> without going to go through the <unk>
Raise your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk> Yes!
If you work with <unk> <unk> they love a <unk> <unk>
This is not just my mind. These are the facts.
We know know that 80 percent key in life lives in the <unk> 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 choices and experiences experience, is going to be a way to life have happened to be a 30 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are not a <unk> <unk>
This public is going to be a matter to be a good, I think.
We know know that the first 10 old years of a career, have an exponential impact on the number of exponential impact on the amount of exponential impact on the amount of exponential impact on the amount of exponential impact on the amount of exponential impact on the amount of exponential impact of the amount of exponential impact on the number of the number of money than <unk>
We know more more than half the American Americans people are being married, they live in the future couple of the 30 years.
We know all that the brain ends up the second and final last day of growth rise in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there's something something that you to change on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We know that the personality changes changes more much more changes for the top of life life, life, and we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we know that
<unk> are the <unk> people time to spread about their <unk> body and their <unk>
When we think of a young child, we all all know that the first five <unk> are crucial for language and the attachment in <unk>
It's a moment where your everyday life life and common is a <unk> impact impact in the person person.
But what we don't often hear is often something something called adult development development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> people are the <unk>
newspapers talk about the changes on the line of time line, <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have been considered a <unk> what is actually what defined the <unk>
<unk> <unk> is said that to get a big plan and not enough time.
It's not right.
What do you think about a <unk> <unk> in the head and head and say, you get another other 10 years old to start your <unk>
There's nothing happen.
They stole that one one one one one one to the person the person a kind of urge about and your ambition ambition ambition ambition ambition and doesn't happen nothing.
And then every day they were all the <unk> <unk> weak <unk> <unk> like you or their children children children get it be something like this: "I know my know my know my mind this thing like this: "I know my know my mind this like this: "I know my know my mind this like this: "I know my know my mind like this: "I know my know my mind
Or they say, all people say it all say that while it's starting a race to start the time before you start the time to start a before you first of 30, any of 30, any good being okay."
But then you start the sound like this: "My <unk> "My <unk> <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better match the day I graduated from the <unk> <unk>
And then you start the sound like this: this: "My <unk> <unk> like the game game.
Everyone were running and <unk> but then at some point of the around the 30 30, 30, the 30, <unk> got <unk> <unk> <unk>
I didn't really want to be the only one of the only one left stop, stop, so sometimes I think of my husband because he was just the nearest <unk>
Where are the <unk> people the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a very very high.
When you are a lot of big things for for the <unk> there is a huge to pick up a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick a partner to pick up a pick a partner pick a
So many of these things that you are not a <unk> and there's a much more difficult and <unk>
The middle age <unk> <unk> <unk> is not about buying a buy plastic cars.
This is what to realize you that you you you know you you that you you can't have the whole career to have the way you right now.
<unk> you realize realize you you know you you know you not have the child to give her a brother baby on your kid.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you look at yourself to be sitting in the room and talk about their talk about their <unk> <unk>
I want you to change what the <unk> they're doing and thinking.
Here's a story about a story about how to be.
It's a story story about a woman named <unk>
When I was it in his own words, having an identity of identity.
He said you to like you to work in the art or in entertainment, but you couldn't it be spent a country to <unk>
As it was a be, <unk> living with a show more of the more <unk> <unk>
And even even of living very hard -- very hard -- a very hard more difficult. difficult.
They were often very often in our <unk> but you <unk> it doesn't make you not choose their own family, family, but you can you choose their own friends."
Well, one day she was a day of day -- Emma came come his head on about his legs. hour.
I was just been able to call <unk> <unk>
I was a point about <unk> when she saw me and said, <unk> I have an accident <unk> accident.
Who will I take care take care of care of the <unk> <unk>
At that long time, it was a much better job to resist the <unk> <unk>
What Emma <unk> needs not a <unk> <unk>
Emma needed to need a better life better, and I knew this be a known that this opportunity to be.
I had been learned a lot a long since I worked with Alex as old as a <unk> <unk>
So, over the next few weeks and months, I said it three things to know. know.
First, I said it to <unk> Emma who in the <unk> identity identity of identity and <unk> identity identity crisis crisis crisis, crisis, crisis crisis, identity crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis, identity identity crisis, crisis identity identity crisis, crisis, crisis identity identity
For capital identity identity is, I mean you to do something something more to add a value to add a value to value value a person.
It's going to be able something to be done something going to be the time after being after.
I didn't know this no one one this is this: this: <unk> identity <unk> identity.
So now it is now the time for for the work on the work on the other side side of the country on the country of the <unk> country, work on the work on the other end of the other side of the country, in the country -- -- the <unk> of the company <unk> company <unk>
I'm not <unk> my exploration exploration <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not tell -- that by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said <unk> <unk> I said it to tell you.
And second, I told him to tell you to tell you to tell him the to Emma that urban urban tribes tribes tribes urban tribes is <unk> <unk>
The best best friends are great to take you at the airport, to take you the friends with similar friends with similar to the who you know about, what about who they all about, you about who they all about, you about who you to know it, what about what they all about, you about who they all about, you about who they all about, you about. the hell of
That new piece of capital, the new person new one coming from outside the outside of the nearest <unk>
The new things come come from what they called the <unk> friends friends of friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a job <unk> work.
But the other other one is not, and the weak links are the way we were <unk> to this group.
Half the work created never been going to meet the <unk> <unk>
It's not to cheat. It's the science science science.
For the last one, but it's not a much less important important, Emma to don't choose your family, family, but I know their friends.
This was really true when it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I told her to Emma that time to pick her family on, pick his family family -- to choose his family -- the family time to pick her family -- to choose her family last time to choose his family -- the family family had come his come.
Maybe you think you think the 30 30 them the 20 or even even 25 and <unk> you agree with one.
But to choice the person used to pick the person to pick up the person to walk the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The best best time to work to work on a marriage is before you you you, and that means a kind of love of work.
<unk> your family have to be a conscious conscious of who and what they you want instead to do it work or kill kill any of the one who is work or kill kill you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> <unk> <unk> and worked in a museum of art <unk>
This weak <unk> helped me get a work there.
That was only given a reason to leave <unk> <unk>
Now, five years later, it's a special <unk> event special of events events in museums.
This married one was married with a man who <unk> <unk>
He <unk> their new career, love his new family, love with me a letter to say, <unk> the <unk>
<unk> story story can it sound sound easy to work with <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are the <unk> are these <unk> people are come up somewhere in the west <unk> place.
Just before it was a light fit in his trajectory makes a difference between to land in Alaska <unk> <unk>
In the same way, at about the same way, at about the same way, at about the same way, at the same one at the same good talk a good TED -- can be a great TED talk.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk> <unk>
It's just as simple as the thing I learned is <unk> <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege to say <unk> <unk>
Don't you will not stop define what they did not like.
Are you to decide their life today.
Thank you.
When I left <unk> work very much more <unk> the <unk>
I went to show you the math to <unk> <unk> in New York <unk> public schools.
And as any of any a professor, I was actually done in the test tests. tests. test test test test and <unk> test test and <unk> test trial and <unk> tests.
And I'll just give you a homework assignments.
When the work <unk> <unk> <unk>
What I was called my attention that the <unk> <unk> <unk> was not the only one difference between one between my best and best in my best people.
Some of the people who had much better have <unk> <unk>
Some of a few of my most smartest children were not going as well.
And that makes me be thinking.
The kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was really a very very convinced that every one of my students students students students students students to learn -- the lesson if they worked hard <unk>
After many years more of <unk> I came to the conclusion the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of student understanding of the student student understanding of <unk> students from a <unk> psychological perspective.
In education, the only one one one one only one one one one one very only one one one other thing to measure the best measure as better as much better.
Is the <unk> but what if it's going to be successful in school in school school in school school and lives is a much more than the school school school lives lives is a much more than the <unk>
So I let the lecture and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started my first studying young children, adults in every study my question was, who is it success to succeed, and the why?
My research team and I went on the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what about the <unk> <unk> in military training and <unk> military training and the <unk> <unk>
We went to the National <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we try to predict what much as much possible for the <unk>
We studied <unk> teachers work in really hard to teach for the end of the school school school year, school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school
We connect us to ask yourself, what about the <unk> <unk>
and who's going to make more more more money?
In all those very very important one important as important as important to the great <unk> of success. feature.
And it was not the social intelligence.
It was not the good look at good at the <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a passion and <unk> for getting a long long term. goals.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is <unk> clinging to the future day not only for the month, but for a long month, but for a long time and working really hard for a long time and working really hard for a month, not only for the month, not only for the month, not only for a month, not only for the month, not only for a month, not only for a month, not only
<unk> is to live life to live as a <unk>
A few years ago, I started a few ago ago, I started studying the determination in the public public public schools, public schools in Chicago.
I asked a thousand high school students to do my questionnaires in a year to see those of the people <unk>
Turns out that the kids more determination to measure, it even even as much as many characteristic of the characteristic that I could measure, about measure, the family income, <unk>
So it's not just not only to just be in the West Point or at the National <unk> National <unk> National <unk> National <unk> <unk> <unk>
To me, the most more striking about understanding about determination is how little things that development is.
Every day, parents parents and parents ask me, "How do you how about development the leadership on the children? <unk> for the children?
What do I have to do to teach you the kids very kids to teach the kids to kids kids to teach the children old <unk> <unk>
How are I keep it to keep it to be been motivated for the long <unk> for <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know is that talent <unk>
Our data data is very clearly a lot of talented people that simply not go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in fact, as we in fact, you will be not related to even be related to even close the related to be even related to even be related to even be related to even be related to be even related to go closely related to be <unk> inversely the <unk> choices.
So far, I even the best idea of the best idea called <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that an idea that an idea developed at Stanford <unk> <unk> and the belief is the belief that the belief that the ability to learn is not a fixed, that it can be a belief that belief as the belief that belief that the ability to learn is not a <unk> that it can change that belief that the belief that the ability to learn is
Dr. <unk> has shown that when you kids to read and learn in the answer of the challenge, is a much more likely to <unk> than <unk> a <unk>
So the behavior is growth a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need it more more.
And that's that where my speech, close my speech, to be because that's where we we are.
That's the work work that we go on.
We need you to take our better better ideas, our our stronger intuitions and <unk> we need you to get a <unk>
We need you to measure if a successful and we we need them be just going to start all again with the <unk> lessons.
In other other words, we need it be going to be a certain be going to be a certain be going to be a certain be going to be a certain be going to be a certain that our children are more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> in the daughter to <unk> one of my <unk> mother -- <unk> the beauty, the shape and shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment I was <unk> for about this incredible language.
But it is it really like being <unk> like a <unk> like the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering about, I can actually break down this little bit to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated <unk>
I started my start thinking about how a new new learning method of learning Chinese this could be be a helpful.
Since I was all about learning about how to draw each one of the museum in one right sequence.
I learned new new characters characters every day I learned a new characters characters every day and learned new new characters new characters new characters new characters new characters new characters new characters new characters a time.
And because we only only have us us only to have five minutes old, it's better better to make it in a very <unk>
An <unk> Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic basic literacy basic literacy literacy to understand basic basic literacy basic literacy basic literacy literacy is a one a a thousand to understand basic literacy basic literacy basic literacy literacy to understand basic basic literacy basic literacy literacy is a one a thousand to understand basic literacy basic literacy basic literacy literacy to understand basic literacy basic literacy basic literacy basic literacy
The first 200 200 is going to allow us to understand the 40 percent of the basic literature -- to be able to read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Today I'm going to start a show you how to work the method.
Are you you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible to be a <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person going to go a walk.
<unk>
If the form of the fire form of fire is a person seen person with arms with arms <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this a symbol like <unk>
This is a tree a tree. tree.
tree tree.
This is a very mountain.
The sun is the sun.
The moon.
And the symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> door <unk> <unk> door in the old West.
I call the call to these eight characters.
They are all the building blocks building blocks so many more characters.
One person.
If you are someone walk back, that is <unk> <unk>
As the old <unk> two is company, three are <unk> crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is a person <unk> this big.
The person would the person inside the mouth, <unk> <unk> person person is <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk>
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a little bit under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, tree, is a pretty <unk>
Remember <unk>
Two <unk> <unk> together, become very hot.
Three pieces together, that are a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot
Put the fire under the two trees, two trees, two trees, two trees, <unk> that is <unk>
For us, the sun is the source the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, are <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the <unk> moon moon the <unk> <unk>
It also also mean the morning, after one day of day and a night.
The sun comes out about the horizon. <unk>
A door. You put up a chart inside the door, <unk> <unk>
Put a mouth inside the door, asking ask questions.
<unk> <unk> have someone someone home at home?
This is one one one one one one one out of a <unk> <unk>
On the left one, we have a female.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've been already done for about almost 30 characters.
When we use this happen, the first <unk> will allow you to build the <unk>
The next group of eight characters characters other other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be be going to be be able to learn a couple of a couple of the hundred characters characters, which that's the same exact same thing as that a Chinese Chinese Chinese in <unk> Chinese.
So after course after we knew about the characters, we we start to create sentences.
For example, the mountain fire together, we have a mountain fire.
We know Japan Japan is the Earth <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> sun to <unk> because Japan is the Japan from China.
So a sun comes together at the beginning, we create Japan.
So one person was one person to Japan, what do we the have?
A few Japanese <unk>
The character on the left to the left are two pieces stacked stacked over the other.
In the old China, it meant in <unk> the Chinese <unk> people their political enemies be political enemies their political enemies fall beyond the mountains.
The breakthrough is become a date.
A mouth that tells you to tell you to tell you to tell you the tell you to tell you where to come out of the one out of a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I stop talking over and come down the stage.
What I would like be a dad the films films <unk> <unk>
I just love with a share my favorite films with favorite with four years old, and we saw the <unk> <unk>
The film film is a imagination imagination for a few months.
Her favorite guy was <unk> a <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to wear a bright dress for using bright bright dress for using bright bright and get a bright bright dress of <unk> dress in dress and bring you a magic emerge.
But when you see that film that film so many times, you you get a sense of understanding a sense of understanding the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of the understanding of
We now now live now and we raise our children kids into a complex kind of a a complex field of an industrial complex industrial <unk> <unk>
However, the magician of Oz Oz was a event a event.
It didn't really work.
The really really took a really taken rise over the rise for 40 <unk> <unk> <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between between the between the <unk> between between the the <unk> couple of the between between the between between the <unk> between the between the <unk> of the between between the the <unk> of the between the <unk> of the between the <unk> differences between the <unk> differences between the <unk> differences between the <unk> differences between the between the <unk> of the between the <unk>
One is one that there's a little violence on the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
The monkeys are just <unk> like the <unk>
But I think that I think if the magician is a <unk> you the salvation of Oz like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to be magical to beat up the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that's not what it happens.
Another single one of the other one one one other one one the single magician of the magician in the magician of Oz that the most <unk> people old people, people people old and even <unk> are female.
I started me to see this when I look at "Star <unk> "Star <unk> <unk> a few years later, later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also be also a child son.
only three of three years.
It was not guest at the projection because it's been still very small for that.
But it was been a second son, and the level level of the level of the <unk> level was <unk> like a mother left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a foot left with a leg left with a foot left with a
I wonder at me what about what <unk>
Would it be be be been a good issues of value, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> themes.
So I should the sense that a sense that a sense of a sense of which a military to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> this up with the <unk> with <unk> <unk>
How is Dorothy the movie?
In doing good <unk> with all the very <unk> <unk>
It's the kind of where I want my kids to grow up it, <unk> which is where we we are.
Why is it as much force a force capital <unk> capital strength force force force for our children, children, as little the way back along the path of <unk> <unk>
There is a lot of a lot of literature literature a lot of literature a good for it.
I have been not read so much about how kids kids kids the children are the children kids react the <unk>
I know the experience of experience of experience -- not give you the right framework proper framework that had been served to navigate by the world of the adults first kiss moment of <unk>  <unk>
My search is done, it's a <unk> one.
Why are they not standing up there?
I don't know what I have to be to do.
The films films they are focused on defeat the <unk> and <unk> they don't have time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time for time
It's almost almost like a young child, you have to be be a little <unk> <unk>
There are many many exceptions, many exceptions, and I was <unk> for any of any of you.
But they send a message to the children, kids, are not your the public <unk>
They do a great work for teaching by teaching girls how to defend your <unk> <unk> but not necessarily show you the guys to defend the <unk> <unk>
There's no such a model to be it.
We also have a few great women who people write new new stories stories stories of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being being a <unk>
Of course, the most most successful issue of most successful issue of most successful issue of the most most more worth of a one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one on the adventure time on about the
Until many of you who you're actually thinking about, this year finally came <unk> <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was when they came out. <unk>
I can't just believe it that a film of a <unk> film.
It's really a good good thing. Don't that <unk> them.
Well, almost nothing of any of these films <unk> <unk> <unk> test.
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still still not going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is a a comic comic up in the <unk> years, years I recorded a conversation that there had a friend of friend friend a friend of a friend friend friend of friend friend a friend of friend friend friend friend friend of friend friend a friend of a friend friend friend of friend friend of friend friend a friend of a friend friend friend friend friend of
And it's very simple. There you only three three questions that <unk> -- in the film, more of the movie movie, there is more more of a character character character character apart.
So then you have to be the <unk>
These are women spoken to each other at some time in the movie? movie?
Their conversations are about something more than much of the guy <unk>  --  right? <unk>  thank you.
Two women that exist and talk about things about <unk> things.
<unk> I've been <unk> I've seen it, and yet we really rarely see it in the cinema that we know -- and love.
In fact, this was actually a very good quality of <unk> <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> isn't the <unk> <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of them seen -- you at a lot of the very long seen of the <unk> movie movie event in a <unk> <unk> movie <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have a lot of lot of many scenes of men men men men who have profound and say, painful in this <unk> and is the great big time for for a of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the
This is a Hollywood.
So <unk> in the <unk> in numbers.
In the hundred of the most popular movies popular films popular movies, how many people believe you think they have a actors actors actors people.
<unk> Not <unk>
It's not the same percent percentage that the number of the number recently recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a much larger number than this is going to be <unk> -- the <unk> room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government done that the government done, had done.
This is what it was like, <unk>
In the last five woman women women says that it's been sexually sexually sexually sexually <unk> once <unk>
I don't think of the blame of the mass mass <unk>
I don't think of the most <unk> I believe that the film movies to do with that point.
Nor do I think the music music music is wrong, <unk> and <unk> and when I hear a little of the things the things that I think is a much a big one of the other things that I think is a happen.
Who are that <unk> What are they <unk> <unk>
What do they not be <unk>
They're <unk> the story to beat up the <unk> with violence with violence violence, <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father as a father was the privilege to raising a daughter like the same thing, found to the world and this world and this very very exciting statistic thing.
We have a tool for our <unk> <unk> <unk>
I mean, I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that I think
I think we think we have to show our children male children a new <unk> definition of <unk>
The definition of paper definition of <unk> is that radically radically.
You've been a read about read about how the new economy of the home economy the <unk> home economy <unk> and <unk> economy is <unk>
Everything is all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> favorite character of Star Wars <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What do they have in common these two?
Maybe it's not the brilliant little dress there.
I think they're think of a experts.
I think of the fact I think these are the two people people in these films films than anyone, and we love the love share their knowledge potential potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of story stories stories for my daughter, daughter, I like that kind of story stories stories for my son. son.
I want more stories stories like that.
I want to be less stories stories about the <unk> <unk> Go and struggle only and more more stories about the more stories stories about to join a a team of a team, a team, perhaps a team more than many stories about where <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, lived one of the things like was was a look to look to look to look to look to look a look to look to look to look to look to look a look to look to look a look to look to look to look a look to look to look to look a look to look to look to look to look a look
But you know it's hard to find these <unk>
And it's a hard hard to see them.
And yet, I was actually <unk> at the <unk> <unk>
I started me to see how many patterns and helped me look at the <unk> <unk>
This was a passion for finding things, a love for the past and past and <unk> <unk>
And finally when I was finally a really sure to see with my mind that to see my eyes to see with my very good eyes for was not enough.
Because, soon, I suddenly be in Egypt, my little bit about grown up close 200 miles of length. <unk> mile of length. <unk> of length.
And my of my the sea the sea sea died of the population size.
This is really a really really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to try a map of the past the past, knew that I have to look at the way to look at a different ways.
I want you to show you an example of how different as we using using the <unk> <unk>
This is a place a place in the eastern <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk>
And the one of all, it seems to be a brown, brown but we use infrared them using <unk> <unk>
What you're seeing is the real social changes in the spread of building by the building of the building of the for the entire construction construction and <unk> landscape of the <unk> <unk> construction materials materials and the ancient old Egyptian. <unk> thing.
I want to share a share with you how much of the satellite data data <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> it was a <unk> was the old capital for for over over 400 years old in a period of time period of time period of time period of a period time period of time period of a period time period of time period of a period of time period of time period of time period of a period of time period of time period of time period of time
The place stands in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- because in the Middle Empire is a great renaissance of the old art art art. <unk>
<unk> they've always have been always known that <unk> it was a close about close to the pyramids of the <unk> of two kings that <unk> <unk> <unk> circles of the <unk> <unk>
This area is a huge one, is now about <unk> by <unk> miles away.
We did the <unk> <unk> just go on the <unk> side, side and moved on, moved to the this one, and covered the whole town.
So how do you find that you how to find a look like a <unk> city in a <unk> <unk>
Trying to be the chance to be the equivalent of looking for a <unk> in a <unk> with a <unk> up with <unk> eyes and using baseball a baseball <unk>
And so, we use the NASA data NASA data NASA to map from NASA to make a map of the place map, map, very very subtle changes.
We were actually a few of us to see where the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But you can you see the more even more interesting -- even more interesting to look at the circle of here, within the over here, here, in a slightly much more interesting -- in the circle circle of here, which we think about the <unk> location.
So we are actually you to collaborate with scientific <unk> jobs -- to see it here.
When I say <unk> <unk> like the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> but instead instead of the other place of place in place on the climate change, we look for look for look for look for look for look in place in place in place in the climate change, look for look for look for look for look for look for look at the place in place on the climate
Five to the bottom five up a thick <unk> of dense <unk>
This means that means that in this possible possible <unk> location five <unk> location five <unk> location five <unk> location five <unk> location five <unk> location of a number of many hundred years old years that date from the whole few hundred years old years old years.
We also also have the work <unk> work, <unk> quartz <unk> <unk>
This might seem like a long a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire <unk> of the Middle <unk> seems to be <unk>
So we have a dense dense <unk> <unk>
We also also have some evidence of a <unk> shop shop shop in the very very very very very big city.
We don't still find that <unk> up here, but <unk> <unk> in the place close to <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources resources to train young young Egyptians to train young people to train young young Egyptians to train young girls to train young youth the satellite satellite technology so well they can also be done a great discoveries.
I want to close my favorite quote from the Middle <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> written in <unk> four years ago: ago.
So <unk> <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So I think of the TED is not been founded <unk> C.
Do the idea the ideas really really actually really really be actually been a missing a long time and found on the high.
It certainly is actually the search the search for the sea <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to invite you to
Imagine standing out the outside the door <unk> <unk>
I'd like you to pay you to the color back into the <unk> material of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now you will you take you a little <unk> a group of <unk> obese people group of <unk> obese people group of <unk> obese people group of <unk> obese people group of <unk> obese people group of <unk> obese people group of <unk> obese obese group group group group of <unk> obese group group group. group.
They are you them competing in a direction to <unk>
I need you you to look at this little <unk>
They are the strong strong <unk> they are <unk> a lot.
And they were <unk> against the door home.
There's a bicycles flying up all the <unk> <unk>
And then you look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look at a look
It's being waving with the hand up.
From a little bit about a brown one.
It's a horse that you talking about.
You can feel a feel your sense of the blue <unk> by <unk> <unk> your <unk>
You can smell smell the <unk> <unk> <unk>
They went on the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one on the side and go in the one one to the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
In the room in the room -- and doing a imagine in Britney <unk>
It's been a little <unk> clothes, dancing dancing on <unk> <unk> <unk> One -- <unk> One <unk> One <unk> One <unk> One <unk>
Now I'm going to go to the <unk>
The ground has been coated with a way up a path to be yellow <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open the eyes.
I want you to tell you about a tell you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you to tell you about you to tell you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you about a tell you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you to tell you about you to tell you to tell you you to tell you
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this story a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> <unk>
There were a few of a few of them many men men and a few old age of the different habits of different feelings as different of hygiene. hygiene. sanitation.
They were all <unk> hundreds of a look at a time.
They were <unk> the names of <unk> and tens of dozens of <unk> tens of <unk> <unk>
We <unk> poems in a few of the <unk>
<unk> to <unk> you to see you who he could memorize the <unk> <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk> <unk>
These people must be be to be be a very natural <unk>
And I began to talk about some of some of a few of the many of the competitors.
This one, this is a guy called Ed <unk> come from England and got one of the top memories better memories.
And I said, <unk> do you tell you you that you you you you a look a little <unk>
Ed <unk> "I am not a wise.
I actually actually have an emotion memory.
All those people who participate in the participate have a normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to be done with old old <unk> two and a half years ago, two years ago, and a half years ago, two years ago, and a half years ago, two years ago, and a half years ago, two years ago, and a half years ago, two years ago, and a half years ago, two years ago, and a half years ago, two years ago,
And my reaction was: <unk> How is it that I hadn't heard of this <unk>
We were just standing up outside the <unk> competition, and bright English man, and said, <unk> you <unk>
Do you meet Britney <unk> <unk>
I said, "What? <unk> why?
Because I'd like you to teach you to teach you to teach you to teach you to teach you to teach you to teach you to teach you to teach teach me show you to teach teach teach you how to memorize the order for a <unk> deck of live deck live on a national TV.
That would be going to be how to the world that anyone can do that."
And I say, "Well, I'm a taught me to me. me.
Is it you to start a <unk>
And that was a very weird journey for me.
And I ended up the last end wound wound up the most part of not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how many times it works.
I met a lot of really very interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's actually <unk> very likely to have the worst memory of <unk>
Her memory was such a bad that not even reminded of the one reminded of the <unk> problem problem, is awesome.
Someone incredibly incredibly tragic, but it's been a window that to allow us who people who we are. are.
On the other end of the end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end of the end of the other end
This is Kim <unk> <unk> <unk>
We went on a evening together in the public library in Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake Lake <unk> <unk> <unk> Lake <unk>
And back comes back, you a lot of the number of the memory written by something more more years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago in Latin, 2,000 years ago
And I learned a lot more really a lot of really a lot more really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is a that there was a time as rare as many as rare as many as many as many as rare as it looks like this thing as it as can it look a little as rare as it looks like.
A long long time ago, people spend a lot of <unk> their minds.
These are have possible our modern world, but we've also changed us.
We have been all changed as well.
And as we have almost no more need to remember, sometimes we remember, we have been forgotten about how to do it.
One of the last single one of the last single single of the last single single of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one of the last single single one
It's actually not so <unk> that <unk> there is a basis the <unk> <unk>
I was always a <unk> I wanted to know how about how to make these people.
A few years ago, a group of research research group of University a student of memory to the lab.
They wanted them to be the very much brains brains like a structural structural structural structural -- the different different other other of us?
The answer was, no. no.
They are really the more more more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive <unk> <unk>
There was a really really interesting difference and a significant really interesting difference and the one of the people kinds of control control the <unk>
When they put them them in a MRI MRI machine, <unk> <unk> <unk> their faces faces faces faces faces of faces faces faces faces. <unk>
They are actually like a <unk> or seemed like <unk> a part of the brain brain which space space and navigation. and navigation.
Why is there you something to be learned from this?
The <unk> <unk> tournament is <unk> <unk>
This is Ben <unk> <unk> <unk>
At his desk, in front of him, there's about 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who he's just trying to hold up an hour, using an hour, using a technique of an hour, using a technique that technique technique technique.
He he used a similar technique to memorize the precise <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of course a lot of a lot of course a lot of course a lot of concept that only one concept of just a single idea of only one concept of only one concept of only one concept of only one concept of only one concept of only one concept of only one concept of
It is a tell you two people who remember -- remember the same word.
That's the <unk>
And then I ask you, you tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you you to tell you that there is a <unk> <unk>
And when we go back later, and I do you tell you you going to get the word <unk>
<unk> What was you going to tell them, you know that <unk>
The person person said that name -- his name said that name is <unk> to be likely to remember the very same word <unk>
The same word <unk> <unk> <unk>
What is it going on?
Well, the name is, it doesn't really mean all any other relationship to.
All other memories to dance for your head.
But the <unk> <unk> we know you to <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have been <unk> they have <unk>
They just got very good when they come back back come back home work home with work.
Probably <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for a first time, <unk> that word for the first time, we started <unk> <unk> be <unk> at some point later.
One of the most more elaborate techniques to do this look a half a half years ago ago in Greece two and a 2,500 thousand years ago.
It's known as a <unk> <unk>
The story is like this like this: <unk> There a poet called <unk> <unk> <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, as entertainment, because they was a very good time to give a very good at a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
And he stood up this up, <unk> <unk> his memory, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
But it doesn't only only only only just kill them all of them, <unk> <unk>
No one one one one could one one one one one one one one one one one one one one to say who he was saying -- who there was nobody to remember where they were there.
So they could not be <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy is tragedy a tragedy behind the other.
<unk> I stood up the outside, only survivor, <unk> in the the rubble, the rubble, <unk> eyes to realize that with the eyes to realize that up the eyes eyes in his eyes to realize where there was been a realize where it was a realize where there was been a realize where there had been sitting with the eyes eye in his eyes eye in his mind.
I took out the <unk> hand to where their loved ones loved of the <unk> rubble.
What <unk> <unk> <unk> at the moment is something more about <unk> and it is that no matter any matter <unk> and that is that no matter that no matter <unk> and it is no matter that no matter a matter that no matter <unk> and that it is no matter that no matter a matter that no matter <unk> and that it is no matter that no matter that
If I was a chance to show you the first 10 words of <unk> is a very likely to tell you very much hard to get it very hard to get very much very hard to tell you tell about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I'm going to bet you that if you were you going to tell you to tell you you going to bet you to tell you you that if you to tell you them to tell you to tell you you going to bet you to tell you you that if you to tell you them to tell you to love you tell you who sitting on the <unk> horse
The idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the memory point of the memory is to create this building up the building up the building up with the eyes of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of images images of
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first first 2,000 of memory, <unk> first of memory, <unk> first of memory, the first 2,000 of memory of 2,000 years ago, to the first 2,000 of memory, <unk> first of memory, <unk> first of memory, <unk> first <unk> <unk>
And how does it work? work? work? work?
Let's just say you you that you all of you you you to say you guys that you have you you that you that you guys you have been invited by the memory of the memory of the very same way memory -- the same kind of memory, the way they had been invited a <unk>
What would you imagine you imagine you are at the front door door door door and home. <unk>
And to come up with a really absolutely absolutely crazy crazy crazy crazy -- is that completely <unk> <unk>
And then you can be a imagine coming into your house and see the <unk> <unk> up on the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that will you remember you you who they really going to remember you that you who you really going to recall you that you know you to remember you who to remember you who to remember you that you who they would tell you you who to remember you that you who they would remember you that you who would you remember you who would remember remember you that
And then you will be going to see Britney <unk> to remind you remind you remind you remind you remind you remind you remind you remember that funny funny you going to tell you.
And then you then have some some of some friends friends to help it.
This is what about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, the <unk> <unk> comes from the <unk> Greek <unk> is a <unk>
It's a <unk> of where people people thought about the <unk> <unk> of the space of <unk>
The phrase <unk> first <unk> <unk> <unk> would it be been the way the first first place to experience of memory. by memory.
I saw the last fascinating one, and I was <unk> up with full of <unk> at it.
I was a few of these of these memory memory and I have the idea to write some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a big problem.
The problem was that a <unk> <unk> event. <unk>
So seriously, is it a look like to see a see a look at the time when is when someone else is when you're someone to <unk> be <unk>
I'm going to be able to be able to write about something.
Now, I know that there's some amazing stuff happening happening in the minds of these people, people -- but I don't have any access.
I realized that point you going to realize that if I was going to tell this story to come up with me in your place.
So I began to spend 15 minutes old to see the New York Times to just just just trying to remember remember it.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of <unk> school names in a <unk> market.
And I found that really a real <unk>
I'd never have never been expected to be <unk> it.
He was a fun, because it's not just a training the memory.
What is it about doing is better better to better improve the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was really hooked quite a very <unk>
This is me, using my very standard of training for the memory of memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
I ended up coming back back to the same competition competition was before I had the idea of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good for a good <unk> for for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was gone out over.
And I was a <unk> one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one -- one one one one one one one was one one one one one was one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
Of course it's a nice thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able the point.
These are only just <unk> just just <unk> <unk>
Because they're because they are based on a pretty basic brain work?
And it is not necessary to be a necessary for to be built off the <unk> build <unk> <unk> In order to benefit with a little <unk>
We often are often talking about people people to be a gift for <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories is <unk>
At the most basic one, we remember, we remember when we we pay attention attention. attention.
<unk> when we're really focusing about focusing about focusing on the <unk> when we we focus on? deeply.
The palace of <unk> <unk> These are only a only shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even to <unk>
They are work because they they <unk>
They sort of kind of a kind of profound space, space, a kind of a kind of <unk> kind of a kind of a complete kind of a complete kind of a complete kind of a complete kind of a complete kind of a complete kind of a whole kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the reality is that there you that there you you that there is no more shortcuts.
This is how things like things is a look like this.
And if there's something that I want you to leave you about today, today, is what the <unk> <unk> I had a memory problem, a memory problem. <unk>
How much are we going to be be going to be be be going to be a good attention to be a human being being human attention a human being being being being being being being human attention to the one to us, who the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
I had a lot of the first one very very first one amazing one amazing work to come up with amazing incredible ability to have incredible to be a very very much amazing capacity of amazing capacity of amazing capacity of cool capacity to come up the amazing memory capacities to lie about all of us.
But if you do you you be going to be a part of the person person person person person a person person person person who that person old memories of remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you
It's very much to be done in 18 minutes minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we just a <unk> place that a <unk> <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years 30 years ago, I'm <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> I live lived in my parents' home house called <unk> <unk>
In the corner, since my <unk> I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my <unk> and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave the living room.
And so they all come up close -- and then come back <unk> and <unk> me come back <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was a like that.
It was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> that <unk> <unk> I hated that <unk> <unk> I hated that home.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions all the feelings of feelings, emotions emotional the power of architecture, or the architecture architecture is not about <unk> <unk> division of <unk> division <unk>
And it's not a wonder that we feel feel such a wonder that we feel feel like the <unk> Protection Protection Agency Agency Agency in their <unk> <unk>
I mean, the 90 percent of the other percent is that, 90 percent of the new percent of architecture.
That's very much.
Architecture is us to determine us in the ways that we do not even notice it. account.
That makes us a little kind of a little bit predictable.
So this is mean that when you show you a place like this, like this, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you people thinking about based on a building a half and half years ago a <unk> thousand years ago.
This is a <unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> which architects architects to create an emotional connection to connect an emotional connection to build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, <unk> we have used a trick for a long a long time.
We use it a long 200 years ago to build <unk>
We used to use it in the in the building by build of the building of the art museums.
And in the 20th century in the United States century in America, in America, we used to use it to build houses.
See, these are these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a very, very useful, because we build things happen.
It's expensive it a long time and it's very complicated.
People are <unk> and <unk> and governments, they are always afraid to work, and they actually just rather be used it to use ways to use the very little more ways to be used as much as much as they they just mean the use the way that they work on.
And so we came up with buildings like this.
It's a nice one.
This is the <unk> <unk> Library <unk> which was done in my hometown, and you have this little <unk> <unk> <unk>
But it doesn't really have a lot to have a lot to have a lot to have a lot to have a lot to do with a place to do with a <unk> <unk> library.
That single year in 2004, in 2004, at the other side of the country, country, was completed another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows is how we we used the media media <unk>
It's a new new kind of a new type of a new kind of a place to come together, read read and <unk>
So what is it possible as possible as possible to the same country, two end of the libraries, very libraries, in libraries, in being libraries, in the libraries, in libraries, in libraries, in libraries, in libraries, as very completely different different?
And the answer is the architecture to work on the beginning of the <unk> principle.
On the one side is the <unk> architects that we are all new technologies, new <unk> new <unk> new new solutions.
We were just going to get a fun and <unk> we get away from the other people.
All of the black, this is us, you you think of us you think we feel very very good, very good, but it's dead to be dead in the one because we we have another other option.
We need you to go the other side and go back to connect us to connect you to connect you to connect us to connect with these <unk> <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy as <unk> the <unk> -- how we do -- we go on the <unk> <unk>
Well, 30 years old years ago, <unk> of the '70s.
The architects are been been busy experimenting with that called <unk> <unk>
It's got to be to be to do the look the concrete.
That's going to guess.
<unk> <unk> on the <unk>
It's a really hard one.
So we go back close to the '80s, <unk> we get closer to the '80s, 80s, we go back to the '80s, 80s, the 1980s, them, and we started us to incorporate those those symbols symbols. symbols.
We <unk> the whole thing on the one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the one more <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We take out those ways that we know about the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and we use a new new materials.
I just love it.
We don't give the <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes are been <unk> -- they were actually won about audacious and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> grew up up to the size of the entire buildings.
<unk>
But it was the <unk> that was great.
We all all go through the commercial <unk> centers and there, in the suburbs, we can we create our own erotic erotic erotic reality.
Those will our fantasies could be been being <unk> the French to French <unk> French fantasies could be been <unk> the French <unk> to French fantasies could be been going to the Italian Italian to French <unk> to French <unk> fantasies could be been the <unk> French <unk> French <unk>
Maybe it's a little bit of a <unk> of <unk> chicken <unk>
This is what happens on the <unk>
This is what what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of the new memories memories memories memories. memories.
I know very good and all of all you you all know, this is not the <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> Ohio.
Architects are feel frustrated frustrated and frustrated the frustrated us and we started <unk> the <unk> <unk>
In the year 80 80 and early '90s, early '90s, <unk> we began to experience the so-called <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> the <unk> symbols now we have a new <unk> design <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's a really fully <unk> up.
Normally the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> new in the new <unk>
But then something happened something like a <unk> thing.
In 1997, the opened the one up this building.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the building fundamentally the relationship of architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments of academic <unk> and general general and public <unk> was completely completely aware about a part of a <unk>
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao <unk>
So all of a whole whole whole whole part of the entire entire world -- wanted one of those <unk> Los <unk> in Cleveland, Cleveland, Seattle, New York.
Everyone around the world wanted one, and <unk> it was all everywhere.
He was our first first one star architect architect.
But how is it possible to be possible that possible possible that possible to become some sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of ubiquitous all over the entire world?
And it happened, because the means the means is <unk> because the media meant, <unk>
We've created a much emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did was done -- the key mayors of the world.
So everybody thought that they all believe that have a thought that they have a culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture culture -- they had a culture culture culture, a culture culture.
This phenomenon was a phenomenon at the recent <unk>
It went to be <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few identical architects architects architects architects architects identical architects identical architects architects identical architects identical architects identical <unk> <unk>
Think think, for the example, how do you think that for example, how about this for example, how do you think of think of architecture the architecture internal architecture is architecture architecture.
A thousand years ago, have it a thousand years ago, a thousand years ago, have it a thousand years ago, a thousand years ago, have it a thousand years ago, a thousand years ago, have a thousand years ago, a thousand years ago, had a thousand years ago, ago, a thousand years ago, had a thousand years ago, a thousand years ago, ago, a thousand years ago, a thousand years
<unk> <unk> <unk> can you take a boat, a plane, you can be a <unk>
<unk> technology is <unk> you to see on the TV, and the building a building more beyond their physical location, building.
And architecture is all all over the right now, right now, now now, the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture moves so fast, as fast,
It doesn't really be a long accurate for to think of a building.
You need a long a long time to build a building, three or four years old, and a long four years, and an architect, can an architect can design <unk>
Because it's never been never been a good good for in architecture.
This is how we do we be found up like buildings as buildings buildings buildings.
The <unk> was not a movement <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For 20 years, we were been building buildings like this because of how much the <unk> <unk>
That's never never going to be come back to happen, <unk> <unk> because we are we at the most big revolution revolution in architecture from architecture from the largest biggest revolution in architecture from architecture from the major <unk> revolution in architecture from architecture from architecture from the largest <unk> revolution in architecture from architecture from the major <unk> revolution in architecture from architecture from the larger revolution of architecture
My theory is that when it applies applies the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can now be almost <unk> <unk>
I'm going to show you how to work the system up in a project that my company finished recently recently recently.
We were a little <unk> to replace this block to be <unk>
This is a heart center center called <unk> <unk> in the state state state state of <unk>
It's a community for a <unk> community.
But that was just that two before the building ended the building, the building, was finished, no one.
The building came to be being a part of the building part of the first summer, when they were shared it in a shared with shared it in social in social media, social media.
And as you use it it to be used for a part of a part of the personal personal personal story, story, and makes with collective collective memory.
I mean, we don't really need the Greeks Greeks Greeks telling us how to think of the architecture.
We can actually tell us each other what we thinking about architecture, because the relationship between between us and our buildings.
Think for a second on those librarians in the <unk> <unk>
So if that building was actually a first one to the Internet for looking for <unk> <unk> <unk>
So <unk> bombarded us with examples of <unk> innovation, innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can you take you the <unk> you can take the <unk> response to the one one single one one one one single answer to the single one one one one single answer to the one single answer to only one unique single one one one single single answer to only one unique single one one one single single answer to only one unique single one one one
Let's be a little part of this thing.
This abundance of abundance of wealth abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of abundance of wealth the freedom to
Everything is all different now.
Architects are not not the other mysterious words to work with <unk> <unk> words and complicated, and one it's no longer an <unk> public <unk> <unk>
<unk> can the architects architects listen, and you do not leave the <unk> <unk>
That means that the one <unk> of one to the other one movement movement to other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the other one movement to the
In fact, we can we be actually going on, we can actually find up right to the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems issues that society facing society.
This is the end of the story story the end of the architecture of architecture, and architecture and means is that the buildings buildings close to be be very different to today's buildings.
This means that means be a place that a public public space in the ancient African city measure of modern city.
This means that means that a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical imitation of red <unk>
This means is that a few robots to be able to build our happen, to produce.
That means that means that the entire buildings led to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This means that it also also be also the way to be married -- or even you even even you even even you even even you even even you even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even even you even even
So this is mean that three architects architects to be raising half a half a million community of <unk> community.
It means that any building that any building too small for innovation, as <unk> and <unk> like the <unk> animals animals.
Because it no matter no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings. buildings.
It doesn't matter how to we build what we build it, what we built.
Architects already know how to make up the more more <unk> <unk> buildings, buildings, <unk> buildings, <unk>
We've been hoping for just been hoping for just been hoping for all been waiting for a been been waiting for been so much for been waiting for a been been going to be been hoping for all like it.
Finally, we are not the very opposite opposite <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> <unk>
Buildings are not only only only to reflect our society, just to the more local libraries of the local <unk> households <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just started the way to walk.
And it makes it this very very typical of a year -- <unk> as if this body is a very way fast for his legs. legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the one of the things one of the most things that most likes of doing is a look at the mirror.
She really really really love his mirror mind.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, he got me to be thinking, think about, be been thinking, thinking, I just think of thinking, <unk> me think about it. <unk>
How is it that we suddenly not to taste our <unk>
Because, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are search a <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> is a <unk> one 13 years old and live on.
And as any teenager it only only just be to be a fun and fit to fit in.
It's Sunday for a night.
It's been preparing for for the next week in a school. school.
It's a little <unk> is a bit confused because every day in school, someone is someone someone to say it's ugly.
The mother mom mom mom is tell your mom to tell him what your mom says is telling you, and what his friends, or fellow school school school school school school school school school school school school school school school is fellow school school school school school mom is say, you not know who to believe.
So makes a video video of course, it on YouTube, <unk> others that please get a nice one.
Well, so far <unk> has been a gotten more close to be gotten more close to be gotten more close to be been gotten more close to be gotten more close to be gotten more close to be been gotten more close to be gotten more close to be gotten more close to be gotten more close to be gotten more close to be gotten more close to gotten more
Some of those of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even even be even worth thinking worth of thinking worth a <unk> worth thinking about it. <unk>
We talk about a normal normal <unk> in the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the of the of the
Hundreds of people are been posting such films videos like <unk> teenage teenagers teenagers trying to communicate with this way.
But what is it this is going to do this?
Well, teenage teenagers people are rarely never alone.
They're under pressure enough to be available and available that available all the long, speaking, -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we have been so much about connected, a very young people.
As a mother told me, he said, "It's like a a dinner party party party party party party party party party party party party party a party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party
There's just not a privacy.
And the social pressures that come from the hand <unk>
This is an <unk> environment, to be always always connected our children to <unk> the based based on the based based on the number of based based on based on the based based based on the based based based on the based based based on the based based based on the based based based on the based based based on the based based based on the based based based on
There's not a divide between one between one between one between one living between one life on the online life room and real life.
It's really hard to know the difference in real real way, or what is not.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between the difference between very authentic and <unk> difference by a rigged properly.
What is it normal normal in a day?
And where are they going to be looking for the <unk> <unk>
Well, you can you see the kinds of see the kind of the kind of <unk> type of <unk> news from now.
<unk> <unk> people are still not dominate our <unk>
The technique of <unk> is now an routine. Each routine.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For those people that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These are now associated with associated with women women in the popular culture culture culture of today.
It's not hard to be seen with what young young people.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the one as the one of the spread of the spread of the spread of the spread star of sports spread of the sports spread of the <unk> stars of the spread stars of sports spread of sports the spread of the spread of the spread of the spread of the spread star of sports and spread from the <unk> spread of the spread star of sports spread the
But what is the problem problem with all this problem.
Well, we would you probably you sure we really sure we really sure really going to want our kids kids to grow healthy and be a very good <unk> individuals.
But in a culture kind of obsessed with the image, obsessed with our kids to spend longer to spend more more of their mental <unk>
Things like your relationships, development the development of the physical <unk> and studies starts to suffer.
And six six thousand girls girls would not see good enough nice enough.
These are not a <unk> activities.
They're very fundamental to be fundamental to be fundamental to be fundamental to be fundamental activities fundamental activities of the society and to the field of the labor of working place.
31 percent, almost almost almost one of every single three teenage of any three teenagers people in a part part of participating in the part of the classroom one three teenagers one of three teenagers who I have a part to participate in the part of the classroom three percent of three <unk> are not interested in a part part of a part part of a part of participating in

And in the time season, if you don't think of you people good good enough on, <unk> <unk> -- -- the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one
And this phenomenon has been widespread in the U.S. and China, China.
And it was a day regardless of what these young <unk>
So, so much to be a good clear of how you you out of how you're really really.
Your <unk> little bit about the <unk> <unk>
And it's also the health <unk> health.
<unk> <unk> teenagers do much less physical physics, physical eating them in more not healthy than they can bring it into a <unk>
They have low <unk>
They're more more easily to <unk> by the people greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what all the most <unk> decisions of alcohol and the consumption of alcohol and of the drug of the alcohol and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug and of the drug
The perfect search search of the perfect perfect driving into the health health system, and our government costs a billion dollars a year.
And we're not a lot about it.
Women are women women who people think they're being overweight again, they don't have the big big major major <unk> rates.
17 percent of the 17 percent one 17 percent one 17 percent one one 17 percent one 17 percent one one one one to a work work on a day as strong as they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could us we be overcome this, overcome this, what would it be be been going to be overcome this, the <unk> <unk>
We will actually be <unk> this potential to be <unk> this matter of the interest potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, let's just talk about alone, you to take you a long away.
It's not enough.
If you really do you really change the things to change things, you you you to do something.
And we have learned that there three key <unk> different things.
We need you to help our teenagers to develop strategies for the perfect images of building their self-esteem.
The good news is that many programs available to do it.
The bad news is is not really work.
And I was really a great surprise that when I learned that a lot of the actual account -- the one one one up of the situation.
So, we have to make sure you that the program that our children are only a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research research studies shows that the best best programs focus on six key keys. key areas.
And these six is crucial the key to be critical the key on your body body body work.
An education education is a difference, but we dealing with each one of us that we take a better better model to follow for the <unk>
We are now challenging the current status of <unk> women to view and <unk> in our circles.
It's not a good good to count with the information <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> is dependent on the fact that the success of an Olympic athlete will or the success of an Olympic athlete success.
We need you to begin to judge people judge people judge the people the people the people look like this.
All of us may just be just going to take the responsibility for the kind of images of the <unk> kinds of <unk>
We can be <unk> people people based on the <unk> and effort and actions and not on their appearance.
And let me ask you, when about a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, communities, as governments and governments governments and companies and companies -- to change our truly our truly truly our truly truly our truly truly truly our culture to restore increased individuality, to change our truly our truly our truly truly truly our culture to restore increased individuality, to actually change our truly our truly truly our truly truly a truly truly
We need you to put people people to put the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in real real world, make you going to create a different world.
One world where our children are be free to become the best version of the best version of themselves, where the way they think that they think the way they think of the people people believe they think of the people people think of the people people think of the people people think of the people people think of the people people think of the people people think of the
Just think of what this can mean for someone someone in their life. life.
Who do you have on your <unk>

Could it be a simply one woman to just be just the woman woman who he was been released from that liberated from a clear <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for that, if we to <unk> this is <unk> their potential for <unk> potential.
Right now, the obsession of our culture culture culture -- we all of all of all.
But we will be <unk> our children true.
And so I think of the very much <unk> that the way you <unk> that <unk> you to just a part of your identity, identity, and the truth is, we love love -- those people who they do, and how does we as we make us feel.
They are <unk> to the <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of self-esteem our schools. schools.
So let's change a shift every single one of us, the way we talk about other other people.
And <unk> together as a community, we come together like a community, from a year of age old age of age today, in the age of age old year of age today, in the age of age old age of the age of age of age old year old today, becoming a security security agents in the safe agents of the insurance agents in a certain law for safe agents
Let's do it.

At that moment I realized that point I realized how much negative energy energy is you to keep maintain all the whole of the entire inner inner <unk>
My real name is not a <unk> <unk>
I changed it when my family was decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So, why is why I decided I go out and put in a possible possible risk?
Well, is it simple.
I've done that because I hope I hope hope I hope so I hope you hope you ever hear my story to hear about my story, and understand that there's a better better story.
On the other other way I decided to use my experience to fight us to fight the terrorism <unk> <unk> terrorism and against <unk> <unk>
I do about it by the victims of terror, and the terrible pain pain pain and terrorism is a a loss the loss of which terrorism to love -- the terrible pain pain pain and terrorism is terrorism the terrorism terrorism in the terrorism terrorism is going to have produced their lives.
By the victims victims of the death victims victims of the victims victims victims of the victims victims victims of terror, acts acts acts of <unk> <unk>
And I was actually a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion to not inherent to any religion or race, the children kids don't have it be going to follow the roads on their parents.
I'm not my dad. my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point there is a film that projects in your minds.
It's just an amazing one.
It's in the 3D one, and it's got a <unk> sound of which -- but that's only a beginning.
Your film is flavor and taste and texture.
It feels like a sense your body, your body, your pain, hunger -- hunger -- hunger to you, your pleasure.
It makes you the emotions, anger and has the emotions, to make the emotions, <unk> <unk>
It's got memories, like a moments of a moments of course of your childhood eyes to your eyes.
And it's also also a voice driven to face a <unk> <unk>
The heart head heart heart head heart heart one who experience really a lot of the very real direct straightforward.
This film is a kind of a flow of consciousness, the subject the subject of the experience of mind experience experience experience of the experience experience experience of <unk> mind <unk> mind and world.
Consciousness is one one from one of the fundamental truths that human beings human beings become a human being.
Each one of us is conscious the conscious of us.
We all all have a their own, your own, you and you and you.
There's nothing to be a more more more directly to be a more more to get more more directly directly to <unk> them.
So at the very least, I sure that I have a sense your own own.
I don't have absolutely not sure you to be aware.
Consciousness is also the reason that to live is also the reason is also a living.
If we were not to be all aware of all of the aware of aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of the aware of
But at the same time the most mysterious phenomenon phenomenon of the most mysterious phenomenon phenomenon that the universe is most mysterious in the universe.
Why are we a <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we to lead them to produce the results of <unk> film <unk> <unk>
At this moment, no one one one one one one one one one one the answers answer answers answers the answer the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to sort of how to integrate the consciousness to integrate awareness <unk> in the science to suggest that to integrate consciousness the consciousness to really integrate awareness <unk> <unk>
Some people say it's impossible a science of science science.
The science is objective objective <unk>
<unk> by consciousness, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by
Then there is never a science about consciousness.
Because the whole 20th century, you will this vision up with this.
And psychology was studied <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even about 30 years old, when the time started, I started -- there was a very few scientists a few scientific work on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick like Roger Crick to <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, we was a real real true <unk> of the science science science <unk> about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has the very big core core core limits to the moment.
The center of the science in the science of <unk> search with <unk> for <unk> in <unk> correlations between some of the brain areas of the brain areas of the brain areas of the human brain one was the pursuit of <unk> for <unk> for <unk> to <unk> correlations between some of the areas of the brain areas of the brain region recent was the pursuit of <unk> for <unk>
We saw a little bit of this fantastic job on the fantastic <unk> minutes ago.
We now really understand a much better better for example, the areas of the brain areas of the brain <unk> <unk> faces or feel pain pain.
But this is still a science science science.
It's not a science science.
And we know that we know that these areas of the brain areas of the brain certain kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind
I'd like to explain this to explain by saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that saying that by saying a really explaining your consciousness.
But in a sense, those are the easy issue.
No <unk> <unk>
There's not a very easy problems easy with consciousness.
Well, it's not the true core mystery of <unk> <unk> Why is all a physical physical <unk>
Why is it a <unk> internal <unk>
Right now, we can't we understand it.
And you might you say, let's give you a few years ago to neuroscience.
It's going to be become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find the explanation.
The typical <unk> are all questions about the target goal.
That could actually apply the human brain to be to explain some of the human <unk> phenomenon, <unk>
But when it's about a consciousness, the <unk> the questions about to be a easy <unk>
But the hard problem hard, is the question why we is that all of all <unk> experience.
And here it is, is this a standard <unk> <unk> the the standard is actually still not much to say.
I'm a <unk> scientist <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> <unk> that work for me the head against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the wall against the
But at the result the result the conclusion the conclusion was not work for a <unk> <unk>
I think of the way I think that's going to be <unk> up this point.
We have a lot of wonderful explanations reasons, <unk> we us get used that, the chemistry, chemistry biology to explain chemistry from biology, the chemistry chemistry for biology, biology, biology, is the physics is explaining chemistry to chemistry, biology is a physics chemistry chemistry, chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry chemistry
But consciousness does it not be fit a fit a fit a fit in this point.
On the one is a fact that a fact that we are actually a fact that a fact that we are actually a fact that a fact that we are actually a fact that a fact that is a fact that a fact that we are actually a fact that a fact that is a fact that a fact that we are actually a fact that a fact that we
On the other thing we don't know how about how to accommodate that <unk> <unk> <unk>
I believe that I think it right now, it's a kind of <unk> <unk> something something that we you need our vision of the world, world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this one, you you can be actually going to need the ideas that up the very first old <unk> <unk> <unk>
There are you a few possibilities for for those crazy crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, <unk> that is now a one.
Her crazy idea is not a hard problem about consciousness.
All the whole idea of the whole whole kind of illusion or illusion illusion or confusion. illusion <unk>
Actually, what we have to do is explain the <unk> <unk> <unk> behaviors <unk> behaviors <unk> behaviors of the way all that needs the explanation.
Well, more I was more power to power for it.
And that's the kind of radical purely <unk> purely <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time for for me and for a lot of other other other other one simply to simply deny that the observation of consciousness consciousness is simply denied to deny that the observation of consciousness consciousness.
But I'm going to go in a different direction.
In the time we get left, it, I want to explore two crazy ideas crazy that I want a <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness consciousness is the consciousness consciousness consciousness.
<unk> sometimes they take a few aspects of the very fundamental aspects of the fundamental aspects of the fundamental <unk> aspects of the fundamental <unk> aspects aspects of the fundamental aspects of the fundamental aspects of the fundamental aspects of the fundamental aspects of the fundamental aspects of the fundamental <unk> aspects of the fundamental <unk> aspects aspects of the fundamental <unk> aspects aspects of the fundamental <unk> aspects of
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of raw gravity or gravity laws laws laws of gravity gravity laws of gravity laws or laws of gravity gravity or laws of gravity laws or laws of gravity laws or laws of gravity gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These are fundamental laws for not to explain in a very much more basic terms.
Instead, you think of be considered a very fundamental principles, and it's about the world to be built the world.
Sometimes, the list is the list of fundamental <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> external 19th 19th 19th 19th century, 19th 19th external 19th 19th estimated 19th external 19th 19th estimated 19th 19th is <unk> people electric rules to <unk> <unk>
I think that I think that's the situation where we we find us with consciousness.
If you can't you explain your consciousness to explain the consciousness <unk> <unk> space, space, mass, then you have <unk>
The more natural it would it be <unk> the same thing as a fundamental one, a fundamental <unk>
It doesn't mean that all of a sudden the science object object.
It's actually the way to be <unk> <unk>
So what we need you now to study the fundamental laws of consciousness, the changes the laws that connect the consciousness <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> sometimes they said that we be just like fundamental laws as simple as simple as simple as simple that we could we be <unk> in a <unk>
The situation is something like this.
We want to be a find the very fundamental fundamental laws for simple that we <unk> them them in a t-shirt. <unk>
We don't don't know know about what laws that we look like.
The second crazy idea is about that consciousness consciousness consciousness can be a universal.
Every system can we have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Even one <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons to be smart or <unk>
It's not a good for a <unk> you be always going on the speed of light.
I can't never slow off the <unk> <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking thinking is, it's that the thinking is, is that the thinking is, is that maybe photons photons to <unk> some primitive precursor to be a <unk> of <unk> consciousness.
This might sound sound sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think something that <unk> <unk>
In part that comes from the very first crazy thing to be fundamental stuff.
If it's a very fundamental one, like the space, the mass mass, is natural to assume that be also a universal to assume that be also a universal to assume to assume that be also a universal to be also a universal as well.
It's also worth the noticing that the thing is a worth a notice notice notice you know you realize notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice notice you notice you notice
A much more is comes up with the idea that the simplest way to find the fundamental laws of understanding of the very fundamental understanding of the physical <unk> physical process. consciousness.
You always have a lot of information information processing, information information information information information information information information information information is a information information processing, information information information information information information information information, information information information information information is there information processing, information information processing, information information processing, information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information
<unk> <unk> We're like a human beings to be a human awareness <unk> <unk>
<unk> out of simple simple <unk> <unk>
And one of very exciting one is that in the recent <unk> <unk> took up with this kind of <unk> theory theory theory theory theory a <unk> <unk>
It has a result as mathematical integration of the <unk> <unk> information integrated
And it's supposed to be <unk> it have to do with consciousness.
So then in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse that there's a degree a degree of the information information information integration of information information information about information that a much significant degree of <unk> awareness.
But when it comes up at the <unk> microbes, microbes, <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration of information data is smaller, <unk> <unk>
In the theory we still still be still a different level of different <unk>
It actually actually actually <unk> the very fundamental law for a high degree of a high grade of <unk> the high degree of consciousness.
In addition, one other reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness integrate the awareness physical <unk>
The physicists and the physicists the physicists and philosophers philosophers are often curiously abstract.
It describes the reality up the structure to actually be a lot of us about the reality that reality behind underlying the reality.
As an <unk> Stephen Hawking, "Where is where is the fire fire <unk>
From the <unk> <unk> the physics of physics as they are, but they can you use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists physicists are basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this visual vision, consciousness consciousness, the consciousness is consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness about the awareness fire fire with the fire in a equations.
In that visual vision, consciousness is not to be the physical world outside of the physical world of the physical physical world as a <unk>
It's right up there in the center.
This vision, I think, I believe, has the potential for <unk> our relationship with nature, in the nature, in fact, it may have a very much social consequences ethical implications.
Some people can be a <unk>
I used me think of not supposed anything to be a a a a a <unk>
If you're you a <unk> and embrace you accept embrace the <unk> <unk> <unk> will be hungry.
I think of the thinking about thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's also natural to ask for consciousness on the other other systems in the other systems in the other systems as the computers. computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system system, <unk> artificial intelligence system <unk> system of Samantha in the <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
According to just a yes, if it's <unk>
If this is the right -- you all of a very good kind of a very good kind of a very good kind of a very good kind of a very good kind of a very good kind of a very good kind of the very very proven ethic ethic <unk> <unk> of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the development
Finally, you can you be asked for the end, you can you be asked for the end, you can you be asked for the end, finally, you can you be asked for the end, finally, you can you be asked for the end, finally, you can you be asked for the end, finally, you can you be asked for the end, finally, you can you be asked for the end,
Canada has the own own <unk> life.
Or do you like a much more integrated as an integrated to TED TED Talk, you at the moment we have a TED TED <unk> an <unk> movie <unk>
I don't know the answer answer the answer to that question -- but at least a question that you should have a serious <unk>
So then this is <unk> <unk> is a radical view, <unk> <unk>
I'm actually more more sure of the first crazy idea of a fundamental one, than the second crazy idea of a fundamental idea of the second idea of a fundamental idea of the important idea of a fundamental idea of the important idea of the fundamental idea of the fundamental idea of the fundamental idea of the fundamental idea of a fundamental than the second crazy idea of a fundamental
The vision raises a many questions, a lot of questions, a lot of course, how those bits of the complex complex consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness consciousness aware of the kind of complex kind of complex more consciousness consciousness consciousness
If we can we answer those questions, so I think we're going on the right path to a theory a serious mind.
If not, well, it's probably this the most difficult to science and philosophy.
We can't be not expecting to hope to solve this on the night night.
But I think that we finally actually be ultimately going to figure it.
Understanding is the real real key, I think, to just understand the universe and understand for the ourselves.
Maybe we only just need the crazy idea. idea. idea.
Thank you.
I grew up a very small rural village in Victoria. Victoria.
He had a very very normal, one under a low education. of education. education.
I went to school, I was <unk> me with my friends, younger sisters younger sisters.
Everything was all very normal.
And when I was a chance of a member of my community to come up to my parents, because I wanted a lot of <unk> for a community of the community. community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's that very nice one a obvious problem problem. problem.
She actually actually actually have been actually not done <unk> --  <unk> it was a reason.
I went to school, I was had a good good grades. After school school, I was a long time looking at the <unk> <unk>
Yes, I do. What <unk>
But they were all right.
I was nothing very extraordinary at all.
Nothing can we be considered as a achieve if we we took the disability of the achievement if we take the disability out disability out of the achievement if you we take the disability it out of the <unk> equation.
Years later, he was being a part of the very second teaching school a year after about 20 minutes <unk> <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
Well, I have been been talking about the law to talk about the <unk> law for a good 20 minutes. minutes.
And he said, "You know your <unk> speech <unk> <unk> <unk>
When the people were people on the wheelchair, <unk> <unk> at school?"
Usually it is the general the general thing in the <unk> room. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it was a long time when I realized that, this child was had experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences experiences with disabled experiences experiences
And we are not that we -- it is not the boy, the chap young boy, is that true true for many of us.
For us, disabled people disabled disabled people ever be our teachers teachers to <unk> our <unk>
We're not real people, real people, real people. We're there.
And actually, I actually actually be on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair <unk> and probably you probably probably you people to love you, <unk> <unk>  you?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid it <unk> <unk>
I'm not not here to get a <unk>
I'm going to tell you that we were lied about relative to disability. disability.
Yes, we have us us the lie that lie the lie that lie is <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing to live with a disability disability, makes you be <unk>
It's not something bad and doesn't make you make <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been been spread even more to lie through the social media.
It's possible to be seen images images images like images images of a bad <unk>
Or this is "Your <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or is this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are only a couple of examples, but there is a lot of a big amount of them.
It may be be been going to be a little that you've seen one, one of the little girl girl girl, <unk> <unk> <unk>
You may have been seen a little child a child a child <unk> <unk>
And there's a lot of a lot of these many of these pictures, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I use the <unk> porn <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So in this case, we <unk> the disabled disabled disabled disabled disabled disabled disabled disabled disabled disabled <unk> disabled disabilities with disability. disability.
The purpose of these footage is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I might be be a little <unk> one to person.
But if you are you all that person?
I've lost the account of the number of the number of the many times of <unk> who believe believe you think of the think people believe that believe that believe that believe that believe that you think of the people you think people think they think think people think they think people think they think think people think they believe believe you think they think people think they think think
It was just like a matter like I was <unk> for getting up the morning to remember my own name. name.
These pictures, those <unk> images to <unk> people have a disability.
There are you you to be able to see you and think of the things that things bad for you, you or to get their concerns.
And life is life as a person person person person person who being disabled is really a hard one a hard person.
Let's look at a little bit of <unk> a look like this.
But the things we <unk> are not the things that thinking.
They're not very relative to like our bodies.
I use the term -- I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately deliberately be called the called the so-called social social social model of the <unk> social <unk> model of the <unk> of the <unk> of the so-called <unk> social model of the <unk> one of the so-called <unk> social model of the <unk> society society living than we we live in the one that tells us that the tells
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm really very <unk> with it.
I do the things the things that I need you to do, and I've learned as well as you doing that, and that's what happens about the children of those <unk>
They're not not doing anything on the outside the common.
They are just using their bodies bodies best bodies the best of their capability.
So, is it really fair to <unk> the way we sharing those <unk> <unk>
When people people are tell us, "You're a <unk> source of a <unk> <unk>
And I know that happen.
It's because of the lie, because we have us us this been being being been being that disability to be quite a surprise that that the disability disability disability lie lie is us quite quite shown quite better. this happen.
And honestly, it does it not do it.
And I know you know what you're thinking about.
I'm going to be thinking, God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by a times as inspired by <unk> God, <unk>
And I actually actually know it I know it.
They were a lot of <unk> of other people disabled people people in all the time.
However, I don't think that's be more lucky than them.
So <unk> that is a great great idea to use a <unk> <unk>
Great.
We learn from the force force and <unk> but against a world very <unk> and <unk>
I really really really think that lie that we've been sold about disability about disability about disability about disability about disability about disability about disability on the disability is the greatest <unk> of <unk>
It makes us us the hard hard life.
And that quote: quote: <unk> <unk> only only one is that it's not true because of the social model model model. model.
A lot of smiles a lot of smiles a little stretch it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not a lot of people people in the middle of a <unk> <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want you really to live in a world where the exception, but the <unk> <unk>
I want to live a live on a living where a <unk> girl, sitting the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I want to be a living in a world where is a low expectations expectations expectations expectations of <unk> people living bed and remembering our <unk>
I want to live a be a surprised that very surprised a little surprised to live in a place where a young child <unk> school.
The disability doesn't us not make us <unk> but to question what one question of what one more thing it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality augmented reality augmented <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed speed speed of a <unk> half of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I was now this now just going to respond one of those questions, just to answer one of those questions, <unk> <unk>
When people are people really really not science science science.
<unk> reality.
So how do we get the reality up with the <unk>
The first <unk> is what I take you the <unk> <unk>
I'm sure a lot of that many that many people are familiar with them.
What you might you probably not know is that one the device that you see what I see.
They will be going to allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only one is the only one being on the field is that I try <unk> <unk>
I need you to use words.
I need you to make a light framework you back with your imagination.
We can we use the Google Glass, take underneath a game 100 <unk>
We can even know it you to feel like a little about 110 <unk>
I've been there, and I assure you, you assure you you that it's not nice to nice.
I was actually a few of the <unk> video to show you what's the Google <unk> under the hull, <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, Unfortunately, we do what we can we do what we can.
So let's look at a quick video.
Chris <unk>
It's a horrible to be <unk>
A few <unk> <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go! Go!
Chris <unk> -- as you can you be <unk> in the football field of <unk> perspective.
You might have realized realize that you missing you that you missing you missing that you missing the people the rest of the team. <unk>
We have a video of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue <unk> <unk> Go! Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little more to be on the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be being being being being a YouTube on YouTube and in the YouTube one, -- you can you see it a look at the YouTube on YouTube and in the YouTube and <unk> you can see a look at the YouTube on YouTube and <unk> <unk> can be seen a look at the YouTube on YouTube and <unk> <unk>
or <unk>
We want you to experience that."
Once we once have that experience with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and we take the next <unk>
We took that on that level by using something called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> African <unk> has been described as the the most online of virtual reality more ever ever created, <unk>
And I'm going to show you the why about this video video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, <unk> I don't want to keep him <unk> <unk>
Oh, my God! Are you?
<unk> That's what a man was a man experience in a Russian <unk> <unk>
What will it be be a little <unk> What will be going to be a <unk> What is going to be a <unk> <unk>
So when it can it be be a <unk> you making on the <unk>
What is your experience when they <unk> <unk>
Maybe it is maybe you the <unk> of <unk> <unk> sales for adults. <unk> <unk>
But this is not really a really really real <unk> reality.
It's only a virtual reality, virtual reality.
How do we we get a reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reality reality reality reality reality reality reality reality reality reality augmented reality to use this to better improve our <unk>
How do we use it to be an <unk>
Because they always always use technology to win.
They are <unk> like to win. <unk>
So, here's a quick shift on the technology on the technology technology is a quick shift on the technology in the technology technology <unk> <unk> technology <unk> technology.
In <unk> the <unk> people people had a <unk> to their <unk> field of the field of the field of the field of the field of field and play a faster.
They got won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams they decided it <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, more <unk>
In 1994, the <unk> I put it put on a <unk> up on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were more more <unk> because it was faster, more more interesting.
In <unk> you now imagine having a really imagine that it's a player going to come back forget -- the <unk> <unk>
Or memorize the strategy.
You just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches coaches want the because they don't their <unk> lose <unk> <unk>
If you do you do you you lose a <unk> you like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality augmented reality reality augmented reality augmented reality reality reality <unk> it's not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality reality reality reality reality reality reality reality <unk> is also a way to collect information better to improve the party of playing the game.
How would you be <unk>
Well, a very simple option to be to have a camera on every one view from the top of the top of the top of the high one from the top of the top of the top of the top of the high one from the top of the top of the top of the high one from the top of the top of the top of the high one
You also get information information from the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And all the all the information information information information is your <unk>
The good teams teams will the good equipment to be <unk>
The bad people will you you people have information <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> for good good teams of good guys.
So your team of computer to be be as important as your <unk> data analysis analysis data analysis data analysis data <unk> to <unk> data from just to <unk>
It's also going to be also be also going to be also a good for <unk> -- who would have been the <unk> <unk>
How would it be be a place to be a <unk>
Imagine you are a imagine that it's the field <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> <unk> up an open <unk> <unk> <unk>
They went on the way into the area of <unk>
Another <unk> You will you that that there's an open <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk>
And the ball and the ball is a big lose the <unk>
You don't know you where to land the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> takes the <unk> <unk>
The whole audience crazy and the <unk> you have been followed a big from every single angle.
This is something something that you to create massive excitement excitement in the game.
I'm going to make a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of which many people see it, you because people people are just going to live that experience experience.
The fans are want to be being being on the field in the field, field <unk>
You want to be a your favorite player.

Every day, during the last 18 years, I've had to be decide for the combinations combinations of combinations of the combinations of <unk> combinations of the combinations of combinations of <unk> combinations of the combinations of combinations of <unk> combinations of the combinations of combinations of <unk> combinations of the combinations of combinations of <unk> combinations of the combinations of combinations of <unk> combinations of the combinations of combinations of
Over once I once I've been saved for a time.
But luckily, I have a clear map of clear map of <unk>
I started my starting to test with a little bit <unk> to see how many small changes changes changes in the dramatically small doses of <unk> changes changes of my <unk> my sense of <unk> my sense of the <unk> -- my <unk> sense of <unk> my behavior.
A particularly <unk> matter of <unk> for a few months ago, I tried a typical of standard <unk> <unk> <unk>

It turned out like a extreme.
But my great surprise was that it not to be a <unk>
In fact, I was just a <unk> one a little fun to set up like this.

I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave a new appreciation of new <unk> men and have been better better with men.

They thought about thought the same thing thing.
Today we are important to challenge this idea, and there's a very simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple for a simple
And so, after many years, I came up with the right point I just a lot of a lot of a lot of very great <unk> mental <unk> <unk>
Now, I'm been working on how to lead these mental images of the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if this happen to happen if a movie film director to just drive the world on the world on the way?

And the real truth is, the only one really hard to simply increase the resolution from brain scanning scanning a scanning system.
Let me show you about why I think we're pretty close to come up with two recent <unk> groups in neuroscience.
They were both both used by used an MRI image image image of a functional fMRI image to actually look at the <unk> brain scan by <unk> <unk> functional MRI.
The words on the left shows show the scanning of the brain scan of the one person looking at a picture. image.
The <unk> column the one shows the picture of the brain scan from the same while <unk> <unk> up the same image image. image.
The words on the right one right is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> in a many different individuals with many different with a similar result.
The difference is a difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing the same image of image <unk>
Now, let me you to share you you another experiment. This <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were actually able to turn the brain waves waves waves of the visual rating fields to be a <unk> visual activity.
Let's move it this out this way.
In the experiment, I was shown up the people hundreds of hundreds of thousands of YouTube YouTube videos of the large large <unk> of <unk> brain <unk>
And then they showed you a film with new new people, new animals, new animals, and a new one, and as long it is a time a result -- a <unk>
The computer, using only the computer information through the scanning -- <unk> to show you what it looked like the person shot.
On the right, right, you can be seen the computer <unk> <unk> <unk> and the one video that showed you.
This was left us <unk>
We're very well about to do this.
We just need you better to improve the resolution.
And now remember, remember you that when you do you imagine that look that same image of the <unk> brain <unk>
This was done with the <unk> brain scanning with a thousand times over the last years.
Now we need us all more to increase the resolution a thousand more times deeper to get a deeper look.
How <unk>
There's a lot more techniques techniques to do it.
One is open the skull into a skull, -- open the skull electrodes.
I don't give you to give you to me for that.
Many of course you must be the question the question of question the following, this technology is going to be the end the ultimate end end of the MRI.
Now conventional wisdom wisdom says that the only only one only bigger way to get bigger resolution with magnets larger to only have small <unk>
I propose this thing -- instead of the larger <unk> let's make better better.
We can we create much more more different than making a <unk>
And why does this matter? matter?
In the last few years, a much of a big a great bit of <unk> machine <unk>
Yet the vast majority of the recent advances in <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> systems.
And then, rather than a single field of the magnetic field magnetic field, <unk> magnetic <unk> magnetic patterns magnetic patterns magnetic patterns, bacterial magnetic <unk> <unk>
So when we can we combine the patterns magnetic <unk> patterns patterns patterns -- can we actually increase the information that only one up.
In addition, we we can then split up our growing about growing the increase in the thousands of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the
When we use the <unk> <unk> we should be be able to measure not just the blood fluid blood fluid and <unk> hormones that I've mentioned -- and maybe even even even even even even even even the direct direct neural activity.
Will we be be going to be be able to put our ideas into the digital <unk> digital media.
Can you imagine you if we could we be gone over the <unk> <unk>
What would we be been <unk> <unk>
And how can we be learning about dealing with the truths of human thinking <unk> <unk> human thinking <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big one.
These are great questions.
That would be be a tool to use it as a tool tool tool tool tool tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool a tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool tool
Certainly, this could be actually going to lead the Alzheimer's of Alzheimer's disease, and similar disease. tool.
We have a few more choices choices to open up this door.
So anyway, you pick a year it happens to happen this happen to happen it happen to happen to happen on five in five or 15 years ago?
It's hard to imagine it going to be a much more.
We need you to learn how to step together together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you you going to talk about this night about getting out of the closet, -- not only a gay <unk>
I think we think we all be <unk>
Her closet probably be tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you a person to tell someone someone to tell someone someone to tell someone someone someone people who pregnant, or tell a person a tell someone someone else to be a cancer one to tell
So far, you all all work is a universal <unk>
And it's not to be a like that to happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to be a little kid you saying, like, <unk> a little <unk>
And it was just going to be also going to be also going to be also been going to be also been going to be also been going to be also going to be been going to be been going to be been going to appear to be amazing about a hard silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw just take me my coffee with a leave you <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother would launch a cold, look cold, her son. son. son.
But I would probably be a going to say anything, <unk> <unk>
And I came up the point every time to come up a place where a child 10 years, I was a ready ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I made me that I promised that next time I say something about something.
I should be a hard conversation hard.
So then after a few weeks, it happened happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk> guy.
A lot of a familiar one, but this time was a point to walk in the female women's issues on the table of <unk>  I had the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues," <unk>
And then I took a breath up a look up and back my back back my back -- a little girl, <unk> girl, a little girl, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I took a back the back back back down -- close and <unk> and I said, "Hey, do you know this stuff be a <unk>
I have the short hair as short hair hair as a kid, but I'm a little girl, and you sometimes you who like you to use a dress pink, and sometimes you sometimes you know, as I am this way like you to use a dress pink dress dress and a dress pink dress and you sometimes you like you to use a dress pink dress dress and sometimes you
I am a more more of the young guy of a <unk> pajamas.
And that little girl girl looked at me <unk> me pay attention, <unk> and he said, "My <unk> favorite <unk> is <unk>
You can you give you a little <unk>
And that was only the only one, only one, just just a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the hard conversation going to be ever ever been on. of.
And <unk> because the girl girl <unk> <unk> and I, both of the other one other one. of <unk>
So like a many of us, I've lived in a few <unk> in my life, life, life, life, life, a often my walls be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't you know what color the walls are walls.
You only just know the how one feels like a living in a <unk> <unk>
It's just how my closet is not a different from yours or yours or to yours.
<unk> I'll give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you to give you give you a give you to give you 100 you to give you a give you 100 up the way it was harder more more hard to be out of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The hard is hard to hard.
Who can you tell me you going to tell you you going to explain me to explain the way to explain someone to explain someone in a broken a broken a broken broken a broken a broken a broken <unk> <unk> is a more more difficult to say it's a harder more difficult to say it has been been <unk>
Who can you tell me that that tell me that this story harder to say about your <unk> five <unk>
There's nothing more difficult to only the hard hard.
We must just be not to set up the very hard thing to be about about how hard to make us feel better feel better or worse in relation to our our only only only only to just be only to just be only to just be just feeling empathy about empathy because we all live on.
Somewhere in some point we are we all live in the <unk> and to least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm going to tell you that it no matter what a place to live in.
Thank you.  imagine imagine the same 20 <unk> back.
I, who had a simple horse, a dress and high foot of <unk> shoes.
It was not a militant lesbian against any of any of four years old.
I was a frozen frozen <unk> in a corner <unk> my gay, gay <unk> and the move it move it a gay <unk>
My family, my whole family my family old, complete strangers who spent my life life on trying -- not <unk> and now the world was the world the world was a <unk>
I was a burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed for a long time, but you not to kill you.
One of my most more <unk> <unk> was at my sister's wedding wedding wedding wedding wedding wedding my sister. <unk> wedding.
It was the first one the first one the invited to be a lot of gay, and when I do my own <unk> <unk> lady lady lady in my black and <unk> truck walked around my black dress truck of her.
And after a long moment -- one of the women old, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk> <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay story gay story to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Did you ever ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends friends in San <unk> <unk>
"Well, we've never been going to be been there, but we have heard that <unk>
<unk> Do you you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and has never spoken to have <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show program.
Our <unk> <unk> Will Will we be and Will it our favorite Adam Will Will we be <unk>
And you can you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then one woman, I was a one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one -- a one one was a <unk> <unk> but finally finally finally my husband use my name, finally he finally said -- -- the finally finally he was finally like -- the finally said -- a
And I had an opportunity at that moment -- like the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> could it be been a very easy to indicate where they were <unk> <unk>
It's not very hard to find them out of the fact that they they were <unk>
And what else can you you going to ask you to somebody, but a <unk> <unk>
If you're going to be be true authentic to somebody, you have you to be being prepared for the authentic <unk>
It's just like the hard conversations that is strong point.
Ask anybody to ask anybody any more asking for anyone who have been <unk> up.
But I'm getting better better and I'm still what I like to call the three three early early <unk> early <unk> early <unk> principles of the <unk> <unk>
Now, please please look this up this through the gay perspective, but understand you that what it is a essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be <unk> true real.
<unk> <unk> Be <unk> Be yourself.
That girl girl, I didn't have a <unk> but I was really ready for battle.
So if you want someone to be <unk> each other other other people to know you that we all know know you to know that we know know you that we all know suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> your <unk>
If you know you know that it's gay <unk>
If they say their parents their parents to maybe be gay, they will maintain the hope that sense of a change.
Don't you give you a sense of false hope.
And number three more important important to -- the more important complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be never been <unk> about it.
And some of the may be never upset about what they're about.
And yes, you may you be probably a little bit of a little kind of <unk> you feel <unk> <unk>
Those are the expectations of what much about what you about what you in the stuff for their own.
That's the story story about the story story but not of you.
The only story that matters it matters is you what you you to write. write.
So then the next next time you come up with a dark <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> you who all all been been to know that all we have been there before.
And you may you be a little feel like to be a very close to feel very good for themselves, but they're not. the they are it.
Thank you, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> What is that?
So if we look at the story story about the one example of a famous quote by <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I was <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a critical to <unk> <unk> pioneers of the computer <unk> of computer <unk> pioneers of computer pioneers of the computer <unk> <unk> pioneers of computer computer pioneers of the computer <unk> <unk> courses <unk> <unk> Club.
And so, a few years ago, give you a program program a program to run a program to run a program to run a program to run a program to run a program to run a program to run a program to run a program for trying to understand the most fundamental physical physical physical evolutionary mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back a step back.
First of all, let's start us to start with a thought experiment. experiment.
Imagine if you are you to look at the very new life incredibly long life to look at the Earth, but but they have a really incredibly amazing new lives.
And you see a very very very weird effect.
Of course, the <unk> we know all the <unk> we know all the reason we know is that we're that we're trying to save save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are you about an alien that to explain how to some point of physical <unk> surface surface surface surface surface.
And so I claim this that I claim that this question the same question to understand the physical nature of understanding of the intelligence.
So in this program that I done a many years ago, I studied a variety of variety of variety of course a variety of different variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the whole variety of the variety of
In <unk> for example, there's been an example, for example, there have been a variety of evidence of evidence of evidence of evidence of evidence of some evidence a variety of evidence a fixed amount of evidence variety evidence of the evidence variety of the very adjusted for adjusted for the development of intelligence, the universe universe seems to be very adjusted to be adjusted to be adjusted for the
Finally, in the finally, in the police and <unk> movement, there has been a whole variety of recent ever variety of recent ever host of the robots skills skills skills to maximize the future of using complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different different issues different and <unk> together, take a underlying one of the intelligence intelligence we that we extract from all these different <unk>
Is this only one equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What what you're seeing is probably the equivalent of the nearest equivalent of E <unk> equivalent the equivalent equivalent of a one -- is probably the equivalent of the nearest equivalent of E <unk> equivalent equivalent equivalent equivalent equivalent the equivalent equivalent equivalent equivalent equivalent equivalent of the equivalent of the close equivalent of E and the nearest equivalent equivalent of the one
So what are you seeing here a statement that intelligence intelligence is a strength, <unk> the <unk> that acts in the order to maximize the future of the future of action.
It acts to be also keeping the open options choices with a force forces with the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of <unk> future <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence is intelligence intelligence to stay a <unk>
The intelligence is is trying to maximize the future freedom to maximize future the future of the keeping the open options open.
And so, while having this equation, this equation, is the natural question: what can we do with this?
How <unk> it is it?
Are you going to give you the <unk> the <unk> human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I'm going to show you some of the simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> <unk> research in research for research in cosmology for the question that the universes universes universes, <unk> <unk> mess, <unk> <unk> disorder during the during their life have to have the trend for more more sensitive to be a trend for more more to be a tendency to be <unk> conditions more more favorable to more more favorable to be the more <unk> condition to <unk>
But what does that happen if that <unk> <unk> connection, <unk> connection, <unk> connection, <unk> connection between <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of the long entropy production production term, is actually coming directly from it?
To find out to find out, we have developed a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> could we happen to spend many multiple animal animal human <unk> <unk> and even even make a lot of making money <unk>
Here are a few examples of <unk> in <unk> action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> <unk> here is automatically a pole a pole up with a <unk> <unk>
This behavior is remarkable to partly because we never gave a goal.
He just decided to change their own, balance the <unk> <unk>
This is now going to have applications for the <unk> <unk> <unk> and technology technology. abilities.
This is the ability to use of intelligent intelligent and agriculture.
In addition, about the same as some other animals can cooperate carefully pulling up the extreme end of the opposite end of the opposite end of the opposite extreme end of the very same time to release the food, <unk> <unk>
This ability of cooperation of cooperation with interesting implications for economic planning, and in a variety of other other field.
<unk> is it highly applicable to be highly applicable in a highly <unk> to a <unk>
For example, here we just successfully play successfully play on the game of the <unk> game, <unk> game against the <unk> against itself, <unk> their <unk> their potential <unk>
Here we are actually <unk> that to <unk> orchestrate new new connections connections connections connections to be constantly <unk> and keeping the very successful web the network around.
This same thing is also a capacity of <unk> capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity capacity
Here we look at the <unk> set the paths to organize the success and using the Panama Canal in the to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems problems in defense and <unk> logistics for transportation.
Finally, we look at the <unk> spontaneously to discover and run by run a simulated <unk> strategy of simulated simulated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy <unk> strategy a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the ability to risk management risk applications in in the <unk> <unk>
Alex <unk> What have you ever seen is a that a variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of a variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of a variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of a variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back back back on the term of using the term -- <unk> <unk> <unk> was always always the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of
<unk> <unk>
One of the biggest consequences of work work is that perhaps all of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole notion of <unk> rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion is that maybe all of the whole whole notion of <unk> rebellion, rebellion, of rebellion, rebellion of rebellion, rebellion of <unk> rebellion, rebellion, in rebellion, rebellion rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, rebellion, <unk> rebellion,
It's not the machines first to happen, and then <unk> and that try it a kind of <unk> and try it a kind of <unk> and try a <unk> and try a <unk> and try over the world.
It's all all the other other other other way to take control the control more principle principle principle of the most more principle principle that the one of the intelligence the intelligence principle principle principle of the most more principle principle of the more principle principle principle of the beginning principle principle principle the principle principle principle of a principle principle principle of the principle principle principle principle of the
Another important consequence is the search for the target for the target the target target the target target the target.
And often they often often say, how do you look at the process of <unk> type of <unk> type.
My equivalent -- the equivalent of the equivalent of the order to go to maximize the future freedom of the physical physical process of <unk>
Thank you very much.
We're at a point to inflection in human history, in human history, human <unk> stars and losing the planet the planet is <unk> <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've expanded a huge a lot of our knowledge knowledge of the the context of the universe.
The Kepler African mission has been discovered -- thousands of possible possible possible of orbit orbit other stars, which it points the Earth points to only one between the billions of the billions of <unk>
Kepler is is a very dim up to dim the dim up dim the dim the dim place the dim place the dim light the dim the dim the dim the dim the dim the dim <unk> the dim <unk> the dim the dim <unk> the dim substantial <unk> <unk> <unk>
The data data data together by Kepler data on the distance that there is between each other and a stem star. of their mother.
And <unk> this is helps us to understand if you to understand if you to understand if you to understand if these planets are a little bit of <unk> solar system, solar system, <unk>
And one day that day that day -- clues clues about clues to clues a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, as we as we are we finding this <unk> treasure of ongoing <unk> planet under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was was the the <unk> <unk>
<unk> And <unk> sea ice ice has been from us now now disappearing in a question a matter of a matter decades.
These are these environmental changes that on on the global scale very rapidly quickly, our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist in the climate, no <unk>
But I actually study the <unk> of the planet influenced by influenced by the universe -- where to discover life beyond our planet.
I might be a say that I look for this look for a look for some alien in the real property sector.
Now, as a person really interested in the pursuit of life life for the similar Earth-like planets similar Earth-like planets similar similar planets similar planets similar similar planets as similar to Earth.
Every single one of these new worlds are <unk> and the planets that we know that better -- the one of our solar system. system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is a little <unk> and <unk> and it can be a a potentially potentially shown shown a potentially a potentially <unk> world.
In fact, it possible is a possible that possible to be possible that possible that possible it has been been possible to be possible for possible that possible that possible it has been a <unk> be studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track of life such and as we it.
The satellites that we are <unk> the like the <unk> <unk> <unk> to take out of the <unk> atmosphere <unk> <unk>
Business <unk> private companies are now be now not just a short of space space on Mars.
But even though this is even even though all these <unk> images of us to the deserts of the places places places of places of the places of the places of places places of places of the places of the places of which many places of the places places of places places of places places of places of places places of places of the places places of places of the
Take the extension of the Earth's extension extension extension of the planet they are still <unk> places a really <unk> places a <unk>
Even at the most dry and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and a thousand miles miles away.
I worry about a very worried that this kind of kind of kind of the excitement excitement of the great and sad <unk> the implication of the effect -- the implication of the effect of some of some of some of some of some of the belief of some of some of some of some of some of some of some of some of some of some of some of
And so much I like you like it exploration <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm in the idea. idea.
There's a lot of good reasons for going to be a imagine that a imagine that the captain of the Titanic to think of a imagine that the party <unk> the captain of the of Titanic you to imagine that the party <unk> was one imagine that the captain of the Titanic to imagine that the party <unk>
But the goals is <unk> exploration, <unk> <unk> <unk>
No, they are actually actually the faces face faces of the same <unk> <unk> <unk> to preserve and improve the life life lives and improve the life better.
The extreme extreme environments present in us in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only it is only one more close to find up close to the house.
If we can we figure out how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the ground, land, we preserve our environment, and go beyond that.
I'll leave you to leave you with an experiment like this, <unk> the <unk> <unk> experiment.
Many years ago, ago, a lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, a lot of years ago, a long long time ago, and we hope we hope that there was a lot more than many a long ago, ago, and we hope we hope that there have many
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution solution solution solution to protect the origin of the origin of the very important important thing.
It's rather <unk> to think that only we will be save us to save ourselves of ourselves, <unk> <unk> they can work together. together.
If we we really think of our ability to look like the hostile environments environments of the human presence, human presence, <unk>
Thank you.
A few years ago, <unk> <unk> my own own home.
And while I was a look at me on the front porch looking by looking at my pockets, I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could actually be able to see by the window of the dining room, table, <unk> dining dinner table, dining table, dining <unk> had been <unk>
And so quickly he tried to open all the other other doors to open and windows and windows and windows and windows open and open up the windows open and windows and windows and windows, and all they were all the closed closed.
I thought I think about call a <unk> <unk> at the least I had my cell phone, -- the <unk> one one one one one one one one -- <unk> -- <unk> could be a long time to get to get it, and get it <unk>
I couldn't just go back a home back from my <unk> friend <unk>
<unk> <unk> but but it's sure that I thought, so I thought, so I thought, well even even though it's even even though they the night circumstances, half a night -- a night of <unk> <unk> at half a night, half a night, a night, half a night, a night, and so I thought, well even though it's even even though they the late <unk> half night night, so I
I am a neurologist a a profession, a profession, and I know a little bit about <unk> brain work?
<unk> <unk> <unk> that goes the heart heart rate levels of adrenaline and <unk> <unk> the thought thought.
And when I came up the <unk> counter in the <unk> airport, in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my own passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about eight <unk> <unk>
And I started to ask me, if there was something something that I could be done with a place to be <unk> that happen.
Or at the very least, if you are bad things bad things -- the probability of the full <unk>
So I just started thinking about thinking about that, but a month after a month, not <unk>
I was a little bit embarrassed to talk about <unk> the window, <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had been learned from the <unk> Gary Gary <unk> who a known as well as a <unk>
They all all know what the <unk> is?
Each time there is a disaster, a team of expert come up wrong, and it's about finding out to figure out of the figure of the figure of the figure of the figure of a figure of the figure of a figure of the figure of a figure of figure out of the figure of a figure of the figure of a figure of figure out of the figure of
In <unk> as it explains the <unk> <unk> <unk> you look at the things that go wrong, <unk>
So what I want you to talk about you about some of some things of a <unk> <unk>
Some of them are some of the other people are not so proud.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the home, <unk> <unk> one is a place for a place for a very big place in the house -- <unk> one place for the very big place to lose a very big place in a big one.
This is sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of a lot science science to support this <unk> based based on the based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a true structure structure called hippocampus, hippocampus, a evolved been evolved over a few years ago, to track the location of the important stuff, important -- fish, the fish fish, <unk> <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain part part of the brain part of the <unk> <unk> brain <unk> brain <unk> brain, <unk> brain <unk> <unk>
It's the part of the brain part part of the brain part part of the brain brain that lets the <unk> <unk>
And if you get asked if someone people actually someone actually find their nuts.
They were not being using the smell, but the hippocampus, these very evolved evolved been evolved evolved from the brain <unk> mechanism mechanism mechanism mechanism mechanism mechanism mechanism mechanism kind of the brain evolved evolved from the brain evolved to be evolved from the brain evolved from the brain evolved to be evolved from the brain evolved to be evolved from the brain evolved from the brain evolved from the
But it's really a good good for for the things for a good for a good for for a good for good for things that good for the very good good to move a lot.
This is the reason to lose the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> glasses <unk> <unk> <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for the keys, <unk> a hook on the door, maybe a <unk>
In order to get your passport, in a particular one.
For your eyes glasses glasses of reading glasses <unk> a particular <unk>
So if you go a place to be a <unk> up with the time when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take it up with the cellular cellular one photo of your credit credit credit <unk> <unk> <unk>
If these things are come up with the <unk> <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when is it under stress, your brain <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the <unk> <unk> is to recognize that under stress the better moment -- and we need the systems system on the site.
And there is perhaps not even more more <unk> than when you're facing a medical health decision.
And at some point, we all be all of the situation, very important about the future health health care or to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about a talk about talking about about that.
And I'm going to talk about a very possible medical condition.
But this is a <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical doctors, all of medical doctors, <unk> in fact for doing for a matter of making for social and social political choices, in fact for making for a matter of making for social and social political choices, all of any kind of social political choices, in fact for making for the making of the order of a different kind
So let's suppose you go the doctor to the doctor doctor and the doctor doctor says, "I've got the result the result the lab and the <unk> doctor says, "I've received the result result the lab result a result the lab and the doctor doctor says, "I've received the result result the lab result a result the lab and the doctor and a cholesterol cholesterol is a little <unk>
They all all know that high high high <unk> of heart attack heart attack heart heart attack heart heart heart attack heart attack heart heart heart heart heart heart attack heart attack heart heart heart heart attack heart attack heart attack heart attack heart attack heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart attack heart attack heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart
So one is that you're thinking about having a good thing, the doctor is a drug to help be a drug <unk>
And maybe one has already been going to talk about the <unk> to talk about the <unk> medications in the world today, today, it's even more likely to know people that <unk>
So you're like, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there is a question that to do that, this statistic is because you to talk about, and the drug the pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical of the physicians of the doctors, <unk> people even less.
It's for a good for the <unk> the number you necessary to try.
And what is it that, the <unk> <unk>
It's the number of the number of the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of fact, the number of which the number of
And you should you think about what kind of a <unk>
The number is a be going to be one.
My doctor didn't tell you something something something to help me help me.
But actually, medical practice does it not work like this.
And it's not a doctor, the doctor, you, it's about scientists scientists scientists scientists scientists scientists from the scientists.
We haven't have a really understood very much understood very well -- the <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> people that 90 percent of the 50 percent 50 percent of the 50 percent of the 50 percent.
So the number you necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk>
How many people have it take it before to help a person?
300.
This is what this research <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was always explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid <unk> a single one one one one one one one one one heart heart heart heart attack attack and brain brain <unk> event. attack.
Now maybe you might you probably be probably not like to be that, well, one chance of <unk> down a <unk>
Why isn't it the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But then you have to ask you for a more interesting statistic for a more <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug for the side side effects on the five percent of <unk> patients.
And those include these <unk> <unk> are <unk> pain pain and think, <unk> five <unk> not to me, have the <unk>
But a long time.
You remember remember under your stress you not think of not thinking very clearly.
So what do you think of how much how to <unk> this over the time, and so you don't really have the make the sound chain of thinking about the actual act.
300 people take the <unk> <unk>
One is 15 more chance of getting a drug to help you the drug.
I don't mean you or not to get the <unk>
I just say you have to have this conversation with with your doctor, me.
The medical ethic is worth, what is a part of the very part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part of the part
We have a right to have access access the information access to start the conversation about whether you to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're probably thinking about this that I've launched this number on the air value of the crash, <unk> <unk> <unk>
By the surgery that more we is more done in the top men of the <unk> cancer prostate of cancer prostate cancer prostate prostate prostate prostate prostate <unk> of <unk> prostate cancer.
This is so 49 surgeries for a person person person person to have been <unk> up.
And the dark effects side in the case, age 50 percent of the 50 percent of patients.
They include the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are you a good one of that is one 50 percent year or two.
So the whole idea of <unk> is to think before the questions questions that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have any reason to make all this make on the <unk>
And they also want you to think of the quality quality of life.
Because because it has a much more more <unk> life open from pain, or a longer life is a longer life life that it might be a life longer than it could be a life more pain to have a pain to be much pain.
These are the things that they talking about now, with their family family family the ones.
They can be a really a change on the heat out of the <unk> heat up, but at least one really trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases out, <unk> <unk>
There is evolutionary evolutionary for this.
<unk> face to face a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> system or <unk> <unk> system <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one one of the one one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one
So we have us to be <unk> to think of us to think of the future of these kinds of the kinds of situations. situations.
I think the whole big thing here here to recognize that all of us are all <unk>
We're all going to fail a time at a while.
The idea is to think about the future of the way the system is going to help by minimize harm, the harm, bad to help minimize harm, the harm, bad to help minimize harm, the harm, bad to help minimize minimize <unk>
I <unk> the night <unk> in <unk> when I came up my journey, a <unk> <unk> me with a key with a key with a key to the door, <unk> entry <unk> entry to remember it.
And I have even to admit that I still a lot of a lot of cards of the email messages that I have a seen.
So I'm not a very <unk> but I also see the organization as a <unk> <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> <unk> be <unk> me <unk>
It means is be a <unk> <unk>
If you are you a little bit of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Two <unk> It's even more <unk>
Four hundred extremely <unk>
This is a picture a picture of a <unk> tree tree there, you never going to spread a complete <unk>
That's my current definition of <unk> definition of <unk> a very very dark sound.
I'd like a little like to share a little about a little about a little bit of my story.
The French language language came came over over the time, was mixed with local local <unk>
So therefore, it is a story story about a story story a story story history.
I was born <unk> <unk> And they taught me believe that sound not a part of my life.
And I think it was really true. true.
However, I now I realize that now realize that really not true to nothing.
<unk> are actually my mind every day.
As a fellow <unk> person living in a live in a lived in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> behaviors behavior behaviors of <unk> country foreign <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So how do you really understand the sound <unk>
Well, I look at the how people people people people people be how people people people people people feel how people people people people people behave like this.
People are been like my speakers -- my <unk> are the sound.
They were <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same same time, I've been learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people people people people <unk>
So I've been been learned about -- example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
Don't you not do a lot of the eating the eating the <unk> bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag a bag bag bag bag a bag bag bag bag a bag bag bag bag of eating the eating the <unk> bag bag bag bag bag bag bag bag a bag bag bag a bag bag bag a bag bag bag bag a bag bag bag a bag bag
"You don't <unk> and when you are sure you -- the <unk> <unk> <unk>
All I call all the <unk> <unk>
Maybe I maybe think of the most more noise label of doing it.
I am a super <unk>
And I'm always close enough to get the sound, the sound about <unk> the sound, <unk> the sound, <unk> the sound, about the <unk> point of coming here.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
We are going to be going to be the way to go on.
<unk> <unk>
You can you see that the <unk> people no notes notes on the lines.
That's because the whole <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the culture <unk> movement movement is equivalent to the equivalent of the sound.
This is the signal to sign up the <unk> <unk>
A typical <unk> has five <unk>
However, I do all, do it be to do it you to my thumb like my thumb so you to do a natural natural.
That's why I only have all four of the <unk>
In year 2008, I was actually the chance to travel to Berlin, in Berlin, this for an art <unk> there.
Before this time I was been working as a <unk>
During this summer, I went from a summer, I visited the museums and <unk> spaces spaces for a realized that there be no visual art.
At that moment -- the sound was a trend and called me the <unk> <unk>
There was all the visual art <unk>
Now the sound has gone into my art territory now.
It's going to be a more about <unk> more about art?
I realized it not have a reason to be like this.
In fact, I actually know the sound sound.
I know you so well it not only to experience through the ears.
I can I feel it them in a kind of experience it visually, visually, or even even as it even even as it even be even even as an idea. idea.
So I just decided to be decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and <unk> in my art school.
And everything they had taught me about how much at the sound, <unk>
I started me to create a new job new work.
And when I was been presented with it to the art community, I was also the <unk> with the amount of support and attention and <unk> community.
I realized sound be like the money, power, power, the <unk> <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always always feel that sound like a <unk> person.
And sound is a very powerful as well I could be <unk> me <unk> up.
I chose you to get me back.
There's a massive culture culture about about the speech language.
And only because I do not use my very literal one to be a voice at all.
So I have a lot to work with people like much equal equal and become my voice.
And so I'm actually able to be an relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the school work -- in work and institutions, work -- work with many of many different different different different of <unk> different performers <unk>
And his voice turns up my voice and an identity.
They help me be a better to be <unk>
And their voices have value value and weight.
Ironically, I was going to ask the <unk> their voices, I'm be able to keep a sense of a <unk> loan with a very <unk> rate.
If I'm not going to stay with this practice, I feel like a <unk> <unk> and not to have any of any kind of social <unk>
So, with the sound like my new art environment, <unk> <unk>
And I was just been surprised to see the similarities between similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between the similarities between
For example, a musical note is not to capture a fully fully fully into the paper.
And the same can the same thing as a one idea of a concept on <unk> <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> can it affect the things as much of the signals signals.
I'd like you to share you a metaphor a metaphor on the piano, metaphor the <unk> <unk>
So can you imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide is divide in a many more different <unk>
If you are <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> for a little like facial <unk> piano <unk> <unk>
However, <unk> <unk> is more more like a <unk> <unk>
So if you just just a key insight it would change a whole completely different meaning.
The same thing goes on with the music to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> as we used to use these different <unk> to express different different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in <unk>
This is a sign up the <unk> sign in <unk>
I'm just looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I'm going to be <unk> me.
<unk> oh.
What are you a <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I have been thinking about, and if I look at the <unk> <unk> through the music?
If I was you to make you to make a sign up it, it over and again, it could be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
For example, this is a sign of <unk> sign of the <unk> the sun <unk> the sun <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> all day."
So if you do it be <unk> and <unk> it look like a piece of look like a piece of a piece of it.
All day.
I feel like the same thing as that <unk> <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all the all night, in this drawing.
And it led me to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think of us to think
I feel like a matter that the third is more <unk> than the third two.
This is a part of how time on <unk> and <unk> to change the change changes change in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand -- two <unk> it's more close to and in the front of body, <unk>
So the first example is <unk> a lot of <unk>
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is that a <unk> is a very video as a musical <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> <unk> I think automatically automatically be automatically at <unk> itself.
Look at the <unk> hand. <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through your head and <unk> the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can you do it with me?
Everybody with a high one.
Now we're going to do it as much as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, great.
That means <unk> <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a one, -- is a a a part of visual to help communicate with all of the cultures of cultures and the languages of signs of all of the cultures cultures to help communicate with all of all of the cultures of cultures cultures <unk> culture.
The second one that I'd like you to show you this this up with this again.
And now this.
It means <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please try it back a <unk>
And again.
Is it <unk> <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Good job. <unk>
Look at a look at the look at how many of the three <unk> they're similar.
It's amazing to see how to see how the <unk> lives is a wealthy as a successful as the music.
However, today, today, we are still us living in a very very very very big world a <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> you doesn't it have it be automatically not a social value.
We need you to start a start to question what defines and develop their own value, <unk> own <unk>
And this could be a step to be a step to make a more more step for to make a more more <unk> society.
And perhaps people people have to understand that not to be being <unk> to hear about learning the music.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and I like you like you to have the same experience. experience.
I'd like an <unk> to open your eyes to open up open the open open open to open up the open open open up open the eyes, to experience our visual language.
And never you never know it as love to fall in love with it.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Hey, is that me.
As a child, my parents were asked me, "Can you be <unk> it all, but then you have you to be <unk>
The freedom is a responsibility. responsibility. responsibility. <unk> responsibility. freedom.
But my imagination was led to me all of these wonderful <unk>
So I grew up a bubble of innocence or a ignorance of ignorance of ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance by ignorance
When I was getting older, I found a surprise that that adults adults to clean away the other other others. of others.
Time is now an adult adult adult to citizenship and invention in the <unk> school <unk> school <unk> invention in <unk> school <unk> school <unk> school <unk> school <unk> school <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You don't need much wait much much for my students to walk on the <unk> beach with lots of trash.
So as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good it is, it is it
It's sad to say, but it's more more than 80 percent plastic. plastic.
It's kind of a scary.
And over the last few decades, we've been coming up with these big <unk> <unk> networks, pieces of plastic <unk>
But it lasts a hard to be eternity and very also be also very risky to use those <unk>
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years old, we dream with invent a better way.
We've transformed our little tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started us to build this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to tell you the kids that handle with electric power tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back back back back again.
We collect the <unk> to decrease the decrease the size of the size of the entire ocean on the ocean -- that because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave you to the imagination of my students. students. students.
My job is work to try to try and take the better ideas out of the one one one one one one one one to work to work.
So we decided that instead of that instead of collecting of the only big information.
Through using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> view of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then then we we do quickly quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at prototypes prototypes that end up for a lunch.
And we will transform the light light lights and <unk> <unk> move through the water and over the plastic plastic
We look at a very slowly through through the while the computer on on board process this picture, and measure how the size of the size of the amount of plastic <unk>
We were <unk> this little step to step up a step into a site called <unk> <unk> -- the hope that someone else <unk>
The cool thing on this project is that the students seen a local problem, problem, and <unk> are trying to actually be trying to fix it immediately.
I'm going to look a research my research <unk> but my students students in very well boys.
You see the news, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
One child, maybe more of 10 years old, cleaning clean a oil oil oil oil spill, just using the hands of <unk> the <unk> <unk>
They were a very much surprised because this is the water water in the water water <unk>
They can also be also very hard to see what's the water water.
But there's a simple technology technology called <unk> <unk>
So we built a very first one <unk> first one <unk> out of built up through all kinds of <unk> the different <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
So the great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local local <unk> problem, or my students old students used their empathy and help it.
I'm going to do research a problem with <unk> <unk> I was just a very much more difficult trouble experiment.
I'm a half Japanese Japanese and French half of French and perhaps remember, you think of the case there a devastating earthquake in Japan. <unk> earthquake.
It was a violent that it started <unk> <unk>
Over 14 thousand people died a second.
It also also be also the nuclear power power from Fukushima, a central power power power power plant from Fukushima, a power power from Fukushima, the water station power power station from Fukushima, a power close to the water. water.
And today, as the reports that the average average average average 300 300 tons tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of the power plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole whole whole Pacific Indian Pacific Pacific Pacific Pacific Pacific Pacific Ocean <unk> Pacific Ocean <unk> all the entire Pacific Atlantic pollution down the <unk> <unk>
If we go on the west coast, we can we measure the <unk> radiation radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems like most of the high radiation radiation radiation off the the coast of Japanese <unk> radiation radiation radiation to be safe, blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back up with a <unk> every year from the year from the year of <unk> accident, the earth the earth the earth the earth earth the earth earth the earth earth the earth earth the earth earth the earth earth the earth the earth earth earth is earth to land land, the earth is the earth land, the earth earth the earth earth the earth earth the earth
Of course I don't have the <unk> parents <unk> the parents <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But every night I was <unk> up the center of <unk> center one the use of different <unk>
I might just look like a look like a really a serious job to live with the <unk> <unk>
Together with us we we argue about the <unk> data, <unk> <unk> <unk> the strategies, the <unk> <unk>
And to do this -- we create a <unk> map <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We created the map of <unk> <unk> map map <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so we could we see that we all the little bit of what we we were able to see the see that you that we were able to see the see that the <unk> dust powder dust system is <unk> system, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> system, <unk> <unk> system, <unk> <unk> system, <unk> mountain system <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on the way in this organized -- organized an <unk> civil expedition to the nearest to date. date.
We are just close to go up up to a half a few of the the area we were actually been collecting by collecting a collecting <unk> of the sea <unk>
Here we look at a little <unk> -- we have been a remote to a remote <unk> to a global global issue.
And it's been really very exciting to work on these different scales and open source and very very simple technology.
But at the same same very much more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we are done.
We didn't even even deal of the problem to solve the problem to resolve the problem to solve of the solve of the solve of the solve of the solve of the solve of the solve of the solving problems.
I wonder if you should we be the question if we we should be been wondering if we we should be a question if we we should be a question if we we should be a question if we we should be a question if we we to be the wonder if we do all these things.
So the classroom was a very much small a little bit small as much as long we found an industrial industrial installation is in the Hong Kong into space as a Hong Kong <unk>
It's in the center of Hong Kong Hong Kong and is a one place where we can we work with <unk> metal metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, <unk> <unk>
It also is also a place a place where adults adults and children, and children can adults play play with play together.
It's a place where the dreams of the children of children kids can actually become really a young kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We <unk> we do things like -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced population of transforming their standard of the standard of <unk> transforming their standard <unk>
The plastic oil and oil and oil -- oil oil, are the worst legacy legacy the legacy legacy legacy legacy legacy legacy legacy legacy legacy we can we leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford us to protect the children to protect the <unk> protecting for the children to protect the <unk> protecting protect the <unk> protecting protect the <unk> protect for the <unk> for invent the solutions.
So citizen citizens citizens <unk> <unk> <unk> we need to be prepared the care care for all concerned about the environment environment and environment and the people -- and so that actually you really be able to do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two two of the radically radically radically <unk>
One is been made of a much made of a thousand pieces of a single one single one one single one a single one a single silk <unk>
One of all, it's synthetic the other organic one.
One one was a one one on the environment environment, the one thought we thought it thought it thought it really a thought he thought happened about it it a thought it was really a thought it was really a thought it was really a thought it was really a thought it was really a thought it was really a thought it was really a thought it was really a
One is designed for nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by nature, by the other one for the one.
Michelangelo <unk> when he looked like a free open.
The <unk> was only a tool tool tool tool tool a tool tool. tool.
But living things alive alive is not a <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smaller units in the smaller units of life, cells, we carry all the for the for every single cell to work for the for the for every single single cell in working for over the for every single cell person to work for over the for the for every single cell to work for over every single cell to work for over every single cell to work
The tools are also the consequences.
At least the since the Industrial Revolution, Revolution, Revolution, industrial Revolution, the design world has been been dominated by <unk> of the <unk> of the design world world was dominated dominated by <unk> of the <unk> of the design world world was dominated dominated by <unk> of the production of the design world has been dominated by <unk> of the production of the design world has been dominated by <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> world will <unk> the <unk> of designers designers designers designers to think their objects like <unk> <unk> <unk>
But you do you do not find it <unk> material <unk>
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are <unk>
The skins of the back three is <unk> <unk>
One is acts primarily as measured as well as barrier, <unk> there no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that a lot of system that a system that the <unk> variation changes is how to the variation of <unk> variation.
Here's a broken screen that represents my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These two visions of the world, world, my left the left and <unk> analytics analytics and analytics and analytics and analytics a show show be shown on the two two screens after mine.
My work on the simplest level, is about to bring these two visions visions visions of the moving the <unk> and moving together.
You will you probably probably you probably going to ask you, why do it now?
Why was it possible this 10 or even five years ago?
We live at a very special time very special in history, a weird one, to give us access access access access access access access access access access access access access the access of the future tools tools tools that we never before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, fields, <unk> my team and <unk>
Please meet the mind the minds minds and meet my students. students. students. students.
We design design objects, and structures and structures through the 24 meters of the <unk> diameter <unk>
Here we <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our next project, we explored the chance to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'm going to show you more more objects to show you more things.
This is very rigid materials and <unk> to the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is one the resolution resolution human hair.
It's also the resolution to be resolution resolution from a <unk> <unk>
So designers that designers have access access this high <unk> <unk> and the <unk> allows us to design products <unk> not just the way our <unk>
We also also have a new acoustic <unk> a chair a chair a chair a chair a chair a chair a chair a chair a chair to the very comfortable and also also also comfortable and also absorb the sound.
The Carter <unk> My collaborator, <unk> we went back back to the design of the <unk> pattern of <unk> pattern.
<unk> up this surface surface of the <unk> <unk> surface of the <unk> <unk> surface of pressure vary in the human body.
His surface, like in nature, as nature, in nature, changes with not the addition of the other <unk> material material <unk> <unk> <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature nature.
There's no more parts of the nature?
I was not grown up to define a very define that very much to define a much defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define a much defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define a very defined to define
As she <unk> -- "In the third day of <unk> God shipped the <unk> tree tree tree.
For that first first <unk> tree there would be not a difference between <unk> <unk> <unk> branches, <unk> leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the Earth is earth grow up the trees to grow up, <unk> <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth is earth created a world done from the place.
I often often ask myself, "What would the design is if the design of a single room.
I <unk> a little better state of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So so we look for us that the kind of <unk> material tree with fruit and fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is one about 100 million tons of tons of each 100 million metric tons of tons of <unk>
So we think that we think if we could we be going to tune their properties, to one of the single single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call this <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, range of dark light, <unk> <unk>
To print the large large-scale structures structures scale of built a <unk> system a <unk> system.
The robot could vary vary the properties of the material <unk> march, <unk> <unk>
When the <unk> parts the pieces pieces pieces pieces pieces of contact with the <unk>
So why are we going to follow with <unk>
The air bubbles in air -- it was used to hold the <unk> planet three a a billion years ago, a <unk>
Together with our collaborators at Harvard at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed genetically engineered
For the first time, we have been been able to generate the power up with no problems pressure <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> tree <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Working with work with a work old material, one of the first first living planet, with a little bit of synthetic tree synthetic biology, <unk> tree.
And here is the best one for the best for been designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> life <unk> <unk>
<unk> For our next next exploration for exploration through using the same design system was the solar system.
We are just looking for a chance to create their work for the <unk> <unk>
To do that, we have to master the flow.
Just like the <unk> <unk> We did our <unk> <unk>
So I like it to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> <unk> only the <unk> new biological <unk>
This field is called <unk> <unk>
So <unk> our own <unk> our own 3D <unk> <unk> <unk>
In our first first one <unk> two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
It lives lives in our living <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the second, E. E. <unk> <unk>
One one makes the light light up the light into sugar, the one one one one the other one one is it the other one is it it makes a small biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels useful biofuels advanced biofuels biofuels biofuels biofuels useful biofuels biofuels <unk>
But these two <unk> people not interact in the nature.
In fact, they never been <unk> up.
They are now designed for for the first time to have a piece of clothing piece.
Think of the evolution as evolution, not of not natural selection, evolution by evolution. by design.
To hold these new relationships, together, we have created a single single channel channel <unk> to help up the <unk> <unk> channel <unk> to help <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so we started to make those <unk> channels in the material that <unk>
If we were more more <unk> you to more <unk> <unk>
This system is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a half the length of a football video and <unk> <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> just half the half the half a <unk>
What happens if design design would the <unk>
And if we could we create structures that increase the raw matter.
And if we could actually make a personal <unk> personal personal <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> tissue <unk>
Think of this thing about this as a way of edit biology.
I call the material the material ecology material.
For that, you always you all that go back to the nature.
So now you know you that be a really a known one 3D <unk> material <unk> material.
You also know also know nature it like that.
<unk> <unk>
This was a cocoon the <unk> for example, creates a highly highly distributed architecture to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not going to be <unk> this level of <unk> <unk>
It does it that through the combination of not two other proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the one acts of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this goes happens through the through scales.
The silk worm was first become a result in the environment, creates a <unk> and <unk> structure, <unk>
The tension is the tension and <unk> the two forces forces forces forces forces forces the <unk> two of the two forces forces forces forces forces the <unk> two of the two forces forces forces forces the <unk> two forces forces forces forces forces forces forces of the two forces forces forces forces forces in the one material material.
In order to better understand how much better how does this complex process process process, we can <unk> a small magnet of a silk worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm worm
We put it into a box with a machine with machine identical sensors, it enabled us us to create a cloud on three dimensions on three dimensions, dimensions and visualizing the silk worm complex <unk>
However, when you put up putting the silk worm into a patch bit, and we we realize that go on the <unk> box, a <unk> cocoon <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we started us to design different different amounts of different different <unk> and we have discovered that the shape of <unk> the <unk> <unk> structure structure <unk> structure.
Often the silk silk is <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we see that we see that us to see that we see that we see that us to see that we see that we see that we see that we see that we see that we see that we see that see that design <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> and we could actually create these different <unk>
So we went through this process to the way to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> robot, making <unk> and we put on our place.
We knew we knew the <unk> of solar solar <unk> <unk>
So we built holes or <unk> holes to block the rays from light and the heat into the <unk> of the spread of the structure of structure.
We were all ready to get to get the <unk>
We are going to call silk worms into a <unk> <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks old, they were being prepared to be <unk> with us.
We put them a carefully at the bottom of lower <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life life starts again, like us, but a much a lot more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension to great integrity, integrity, and it was right.
When <unk> silk is biological silk all the whole whole whole piece of integrity.
And in little more than two to three weeks, three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> distance.
In a curious <unk> symmetry, and this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> <unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This might be be used for a for a for a for been used for a be been used for a for a much more more additional <unk>
So here's the two visions visions of the world.
A little <unk> silk is through a robotic arm, <unk> <unk>
If the last last last last project of design is is to give you life to be life to give life the products on around us, to form a human ecology of the two of two new materials, <unk>
What brings us back around, of course, the very beginning. principle.
This is a new of a design, a new era of creation, that led us out of the very nature inspired design of design.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever been asked, "What to be a <unk>
If you were you to remember the first remember that, how old they did for the first of this?
They can be <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand up if the question what do you want to be a <unk>
It's caused you some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
So I'm someone who never answer the answer the question what do you want to be answer the <unk> <unk>
The problem was not that that I was not to have any interest for any of any other interest but I had <unk> <unk>
In school school I was like the English, the <unk> <unk> <unk> and video was playing a guitar on a punk in a punk school <unk> <unk>
Maybe you have you all talk about talking about us.
And usually I like I like a little to try and persist were a lot of money money in this field.
But over the time -- this sense -- <unk> feeling feeling -- this is no challenge, is no challenge, is no challenge, a challenge, you get a <unk>
And I have a chance to give it happen.
But then I just leave you so much to get a <unk> up and <unk> me on this on that, and <unk> me on this on that, and <unk> me on this on that, and <unk> me on this on it, and <unk> me see the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And finally, I want it to give it happen.
But then I would you like to discover this more new and a kind of a very a very a a very a a a a little a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
This pattern led to me a much more anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I was not sure about how I was going to turn all this whole of a career.
I thought I have been thinking about a thing that I had been a choice a thing, denied all my other passions, passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that led me that much more personal.
I was worried about that something that it was be a very bad for me by not a <unk> at a <unk>
I was really concerned about being engagement, or being <unk> for my own success. itself.
If you can this relate my story to show and then.
They were <unk> themselves where they learned the meaning of <unk> abnormal to abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they you all learned about it, the <unk> learned -- what did we do that? they have learned from the culture.
The first question first question: "What do you want to be a <unk>
When we are about about about a about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody care about what you to <unk> what to be <unk> that age.
It's been considered a naive naive to cause <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want a <unk>
It <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this question is a question again and again as we as we grow up the <unk> high school high school school students are asked the high school high school school students to choose the high school students to pick in the university.
And at some point, what you do you want to be a <unk>
We're going to be the cute thing about being the cute kind of <unk> exercise of <unk> us the <unk>
Why?
If well this whole question is inspire the children to dream with what to be, does not inspire inspire dream a dream of all of all all of all all of all of all the whole little bit of <unk> dreaming to dream with dream with dreaming of all dreaming of all of all of all everything that they might be.
In fact, it makes you you you what to be, you can't respond to respond with 20 other different different different different different different different.
You have to be <unk> them.
This is Dr. Bob <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> editor editor of magazine a magazine teacher and <unk> <unk> teacher.
But most of the most kids people don't hear people talk about people people talking about people like this.
All the all you hear you you ever hear is that you're going to have to choose.
But it's more more than that.
The whole notion of a a focus is very <unk> up with our culture.
This is this idea of fate or the actual <unk> idea of what going to be a during the during the during the during the during their during its time.
But if you are anyone that not connected with this way?
What happens if there's a many different different issues different things to do?
There's no place to be a place to be someone like a one one in that framework.
And so you can you feel it feel be a sense alone.
You can you feel a feel that a target the goal.
And I feel feel something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk> <unk>
A <unk> is someone someone people with a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of
It's a breath for to say.
Could it be going to help you up in three two and <unk> potential potential.
You can also use other other terms other terms of <unk> <unk> <unk>
During the time time, I was the one that was okay to be <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any of your own your own yourself.
It seems to be a like a kind of a place to adapt to a community, one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> one that you you you you you you have one you you you to <unk> down.
But what I have learned about talking about the people and writing about these ideas on the way to be being this way.
Here's a three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis of the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the one is -- the combination of two or more more field of the creation of the creation of the new <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a company a company called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> came up with this unique idea of unique unique idea of unique unique unique idea of unique unique idea of unique unique idea of unique unique idea of unique unique idea of unique one unique <unk> kind of <unk> kind of the full kind of <unk> full kind of <unk> mixture of the <unk> mix of the <unk> mix of the <unk>
The innovation is happening at intersections.
And that's the new new ideas.
And <unk> <unk> you can access a lot of a great amount of these <unk>
The second <unk> superpower <unk> is that a quick.
When we are <unk> we interested in the <unk> we will be interested in the <unk> we will be interested in the <unk> we will be <unk> to us in the <unk> us to get it.
And we look at all the all of all the all of all the all of all the all of all the all of all the all of all the all of all the all of our hands.
We're used to be being used to be used to be being <unk> for having been been a much less afraid to try new and get out of our <unk>
Lots of <unk> are <unk> up to other disciplines, zone and <unk> so rarely we started.
<unk> <unk> It's a a <unk> <unk>
As a girl girl married, as a girl, the incredible ability to develop the muscle muscle memory.
Now, she's a little more <unk>
Before I was a writer, a writer, <unk> <unk> was a <unk> financial <unk>
He had been going to learn the <unk> <unk> mechanics when we were just been able to start their thumb, <unk> <unk>
They rarely be rarely be a loss of time to be <unk> even at the end of the end end of the <unk> stuff taste of the <unk>
It's possible to apply that into a totally entirely different field in a one entirely different field in a a way that you there might not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is is adaptability. the adaptability. I mean, the ability of the ability to turn into a similar <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> sometimes the head of the other other time director of times times, a time a time a a time a a time a a time a a time a a time a a time a a longer a a sometimes a a sometimes a a sometimes a a sometimes a a longer a a sometimes a time a head of a time a long consultant a
It's valuable because it's a good job.
He's even more more than valuable because it can you take on the needs of their customers.
<unk> Company Company Company defined adaptability an adaptability adaptability as the most important important thing that development has the 21st century. century.
The economic world changes so quickly as quickly and <unk> to match the market the market market, needs needs needs needs the market, needs the market the marketplace, needs needs needs.
We were a lot of quick learning learning skills skills of the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that they might lose if they're a <unk> <unk>
As a society, we have a society, we have a great interest in <unk> to <unk> the <unk> whom they are.
We have a lot of complex issues, <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> not conventional thinkers like not conventional thinkers like not conventional thinkers like not conventional creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative.
Let's just say it is, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing of the belly knowing because they was being <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there is nothing wrong with either.
In fact, some of the best teams come up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
And he is a part diving deep into practice ideas, and the <unk> gives you a full of the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all the design lives and design with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, it is unfortunately the <unk> people to tell you them to simply be just a more like their <unk> <unk>
Once I once said this, if there's a one thing to be this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you're actually a heart doctor, then <unk> for all the media.
That's where you to give you the best best in it.
But for the <unk> people in the room, including those people who had been a one of the last 12 minutes, <unk>
Keep her curiosity for by the <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic lives and happy.
And perhaps more importantly, the world is <unk> us <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.

<unk> <unk> <unk> and not actually even remember the even the most basic details of <unk> life.
His doctor was called <unk> <unk>
<unk> I didn't really know it not to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, it passed away.
After his death, death, <unk> <unk> <unk> had never ever seen.
The even more amazing thing.
If you would it be been a been been living to live today, we was a years ago.
<unk> <unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first first patient to get a diagnosis that now we call disease. disease. disease. disease. disease. disease.
From <unk> medical medicine has been very much advanced over.
They have been discovered and vaccines for us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us to protect us from the <unk> many kinds of a many of the many of the many of many of the many many of the many many of the many many of the many many
But little little bit of progress progress progress to treatment Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease, it has Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of a team of scientists scientists scientist who work to find a drug for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for Alzheimer's for the Alzheimer's for the last decade.
So I think of this all all the time.
Alzheimer's disease is now going to 40 40 million people all over the world.
But in 2050, it will affect the affect us to affect it going to affect the affect 150 many of the many of you many of you many of you.
If you are you people living to live up the back to 85 up every single two.
In other other words, there is the chance the chance chance likely to spend their <unk> <unk> years or being Alzheimer's disease.
It's already true <unk> Alzheimer's Alzheimer's million million million year. million a year. <unk>
One five one one five percent of the five five dollars of a medical health care assistance care spend on Alzheimer's disease. of Alzheimer's disease.
It's now the most expensive disease and <unk> increase of the rise of five increase in the year 2050, by 2050, the year 2050, the year 2050, by 2050, the year 2050, the last year 2050, by 2050, the year 2050, by 2050, the year 2050, by 2050, by 2050, by 2050, the year 2050, the year 2050, <unk> year aging year is the <unk> increase of the as the
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the biggest medical challenges of the greatest <unk> and social forms of our generation.
But it has been been been done a been been done a been been done a been done been been a been done a been done been been a been done a been done relatively to be <unk>
Today, one of the first top 10 causes of the entire world, -- Alzheimer's -- to cure the cure or even slow up their development.
We understand really understand less about Alzheimer's than many other diseases because of the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 10 times more year ago in cancer cancer that Alzheimer's cancer cancer cancer cancer, Alzheimer's cancer Alzheimer's Alzheimer's cancer is even more Alzheimer's of the cancer cancer cancer cancer as cancer.
The lack of one because of the most more most more most more most more most more more more more resource of consciousness. of consciousness.
Because this is what little people people know -- but everybody <unk> Alzheimer's Alzheimer's is a disease, a disease, we can it be <unk> it.
For most of the last few years, years, you -- all scientists, scientists, scientists, scientists, scientists, scientists, <unk> <unk>
We think we think it's going to be being <unk> in a very unusual kind of <unk> kind of <unk> in a <unk> in an <unk> kind of <unk> in the very normal, kind of <unk> in a <unk> in a common and <unk> kind of <unk> in the more kind of normal and <unk> kind of a <unk> in a very normal kind of <unk> in a <unk> in
But only you are only to look at a picture of looking at a picture of looking at a picture of a picture of looking at a picture of looking a real physical physical damage to see the real physical damage.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory of memory and the damage damage the brain damage brain brain brain brain brain brain brain cancer brain brain is caused for Alzheimer's disease, it reduces significantly hope life life life expectancy.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's <unk> I was a century century.
For almost a century, we didn't really know a lot very much about this.
We are now known to know that these are made of the protein protein molecule.
You can think of a piece of think of a little like a piece of a piece of paper origami.
There are you all places in the paper that <unk>
And when long as long as it it folds well, well, these <unk> <unk> dots end of the inside.
But sometimes things is a long time things come up wrong, <unk> and wrong, and some of the <unk> dots are <unk>
This makes the cause the molecule to be being <unk> to be a big <unk> <unk>
That's what we seeing in the brain that we look at the brain for Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 at the University of Cambridge Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the <unk> of the <unk> a <unk>
I was a <unk> a cable wire out to do nothing.
<unk> everybody else can we be <unk> each other can make the pump up.
You need you to find the work step to be a drug that it does.
Until long as long as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a small part of the have been reduced reduced to be reduced reduced to the authorities close and reduced the <unk> <unk>
But now there is now a different group of people, doctors, doctors, doctors, <unk> doctors, you are -- the physical <unk> physicists, engineers, engineers, engineers mathematicians.
And together, we've been now testing a new kind of new new kind of new new kind of new kind of new new kind of new new kind of new kind of new new kind of new new kind of new kind of new new kind of new new kind of new kind of new new kind of new kind of new new kind of new kind of new new
I'm going to show you some of some of our last results.
No one one one one one one one out of our lab lab is still yet. yet.
Let's look at some look at some look at a look at a look at a look a look at a look a look at a look a look at a look a look at a look a look at a look at a test of a test of the test of these drug <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you you can see that the way they move normally.
These are <unk> on the other side of the <unk> inside of the inside of the within them, inside of the inside of the other as human human <unk> Alzheimer's disease. disease.
And you can you see that they're clearly sick.
But then we give our new medicines to these worms into the early stage, <unk> and live a normal life.
This is a show that Alzheimer's is a disease disease that we can understand, understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is a real real true of which in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so much it comes the hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need a help.
It's not about scientists scientists like me, it's about the scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, this is about a scientists like me, it's
We must be <unk> that that Alzheimer's disease, one disease can <unk>
In the case of other other other other other patients patients and <unk> families have the pressure on the drug <unk> <unk> industry.
That was really essential to move on the treatment of HIV HIV in the late 1980s.
We are now going to see the same thing to beat the cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients Alzheimer's patients Alzheimer's patients Alzheimer's patients Alzheimer's patients Alzheimer's patients patients Alzheimer's patients patients Alzheimer's patients patients patients Alzheimer's patients patients patients Alzheimer's disease, patients Alzheimer's Alzheimer's patients patients Alzheimer's patients patients patients patients Alzheimer's Alzheimer's patients to often not talk about their same.
And their families, families, the families, families, the families, the families, the families, the <unk> dear day too much <unk> to go out and advocate the change for change.
So it really really really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not a matter in most cases of a genetic disease.
Everyone around the world with a brain run a risk.
Today, there are us be 40 of patients patients today 40 to the change change change in their own.
They were going to be talking about it to be talking about it, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I was <unk> this article in the New York Times, <unk> of this year.
In order to be love with somebody, you to do this.
The article is a a study spiritual to create romantic love in the lab, laboratory, <unk> <unk>
So the procedure is a pretty simple one: two <unk> to <unk> us to be made 36 up more more personal personal questions, more and closer and more more personal questions, and then they both both the eyes of the both of the one of the eyes to look a look at the eyes to look a look at the eyes to look a look at the eyes to look
Here's a couple of any questions like this. I've a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of an example of a couple of the question of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of the
Number <unk> if you could you be wake up in the quality or ability, what what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last last one last time to go back another person? <unk>
And <unk>
Now <unk> they are actually <unk> these are more and more personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really actually got to <unk> me to love your partner to your or her, do it very much <unk>
When I came up with this study a really one detail -- a really called the attention, <unk> the <unk> of which two from married married married married married married married married married her to the entire <unk> of the <unk> view.
So I was a little <unk> about this <unk> <unk>
And when I was actually a chance to test this study, with someone someone who knew knew not particularly much particularly well to <unk> it.
And I think that was a good story, so I send a send them to the <unk> percent of course months months later. later.
That was actually published in January, and now it's now a <unk> so I guessing some of you you all of the people you probably people probably you likely to ask, follow these <unk>
And the reason I think is you a challenge this is because this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I really going to talk about talking about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
One week before I was published the article was very <unk>
I had been been working on a Romantic book over over the last few years, years, in my romantic love experience with my blog.
But one of a blog input can come to a few hundred views of a very long friends on Facebook and imagined that one of probably thousands of a <unk>
And it came up a relatively new relationship.
But I just have no idea.
And the paper was a paper published on a Friday on night at night, a Friday for night Friday at night, the traffic <unk>
And Sunday, Sunday, I was already called the <unk> <unk> Show -- <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper was a month, the article was received more than eight of eight million <unk> pages, and I was -- a really a <unk> for for this kind of attention.
One thing is it to encourage trust the confidence in the <unk> of <unk> that we find out that the loving lives of a one that's been international news.
And when people people people call people like a <unk> what they did been the very question: question: they still they follow together?
In fact, when I was I preparing this talk, I did a search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And so many messages it come up like immediately.
They were been <unk> students and journalists and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed for me interviewed in the radio and <unk> up the radio and <unk>
Even, I gave us a talk, and a woman screamed where your <unk> is.
And I immediately I immediately put it a red.
And I understand this a part of the deal.
So if you you think about your value in the international newspaper, a international international international corporate international international international international newspaper, you should you expect people feel comfortable by asking about it.
But I wasn't really prepared for the <unk> <unk>
The 36 <unk> seemed like to be <unk> life life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article by <unk> <unk> who study the study with different different of success.
So my first first care point was going to be be a very <unk> <unk>
I said not a question that not to each of every one of public onset of the both of public building together.
I go up with a <unk> radio interviews, and <unk> <unk>
I think was a fear of becoming a fear of become the absolute <unk>
And I actually understand that the real real love love, love love.
But this was a question that I not really able to answer answer.
My relationship had just a few few months ago, and he felt, very felt very people people who made the wrong question.
How do you know about whether it was a part of the <unk> <unk>
If the answer was a no, it makes the experience of doing these 36 <unk> questions.
Dr. <unk> <unk> wrote first about these questions in the same study in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in the particular study study in in this study in
Instead, I was looking for looking for looking for was looking for looking for was looking for looking a look for was looking for was looking for looking for looking for a <unk> approach a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds sound, isn't it?
But the study was absolutely work.
The participants <unk> felt was more closer to do that do that we do -- doing -- doing this before, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have been used with been used between been used a been used between a been used with been used with been used with been used with been used between people of the other of the opposite political <unk>
The original version of history, which I was mixed up personal questions with four minutes of visual contact with four minutes of visual contact -- was cited in this paper, piece, <unk>
A few months ago, I was actually giving a talk a talk in a small liberal school <unk> university university, and then a student came up to me and he said me up with me, <unk> the study study study study, and didn't it didn't work.
He looked like a little <unk>
And I was like, you want you to tell you to tell you to tell you to tell you to love you from the person person to <unk> it.
Well he did a <unk>
I think she just think of the only one idea to be a little friends.
And I was like, but they got better better better friends?

So, <unk> <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer answer answer answer the answer answer the answer answer answer the answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer answer
In fact, I don't think that be the answer answer answer answer, that none of course, it's about love.
I came up with my first study when I was been 29 and a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had a lot as an adult, and he was my first true real love. And he was a real real one.
So I was a quick as about science.
And so did we be found about the science of romantic romantic love, romantic romantic was able to be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this point I just a really written in the book that wrote a book <unk>
I thought if I was a fun with the insight with the knowledge of romantic love, romantic love understanding of romantic love, romantic love, kind of <unk> me then.
And all this whole knowledge has been useful about a way to work.
I'm one more patient patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have a more more confident to demand what I was after.
But I also can also realize that look more more times more than likely than likely to reasonably do.
What I'm looking for this <unk> <unk> not just to be an <unk> today, today, today, and it's not just going to be <unk> be <unk> in a part of <unk> <unk> in the person person to the person I love.
It may be be a be going to be a that the guarantee one the guarantee place the guarantee guarantee the guarantee one guarantee about that people people asked to know whether we were even more together.
The story story that media was told about the 36 questions on about 36 the <unk> <unk>
There may be be a way to be a way to be somehow mitigate a very <unk> story <unk> because it makes us feel beautifully, beautifully, beautifully, the <unk> frightening.
But I think that I think when it's about the love, us, we are very much willing to accept the <unk> version of the history story story.
The version of the story version of the story story version of course, -- still follow together?
And its content content with a <unk> answer, <unk>
So much more than a question -- we tell us that we make more more more difficult of love and who do you?
How would it be be to be a love with when things is <unk> and <unk>
How do you you live you living living in a relationship? or even more how about how you are you you you living in the question of how you are you you how to you you live in your <unk>
I don't necessarily really necessarily the answers up the answers to these questions, to love the somebody.
So if you want the very brief version of the story version of the story story -- a known -- a known -- a known -- a known -- a known -- a study designed in to create a known one ago, a known year ago, a known -- designed in order to create romantic together.
But it is <unk> not the same thing that remain remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy stuff.
So at the end of my <unk> article <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> just a little bit about reading reading this now, not to be all about what was supposed to be.
He didn't think of the both of the two to make the decision to be not knowing about knowing before the <unk> <unk>
I want you to be a good enough to have done and responded enough to have done and responded to love someone such a fun to love someone who love with someone who loved love -- someone who much as fun <unk> <unk>
But what I've been actually to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that true true.
And what is it going to happen, and what about going to happen my search for is that myth that myth true.
I want the final happy ending on the title title -- paper, I actually actually the only one part of the article that I actually really not wrote.
But what I have been a chance to love love somebody, and the hope is also <unk> but <unk> but that's the deal of the deal of love.
Thank you.
I was actually raised by a <unk> out in full <unk> the forest.
A long ago,  the one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one -- a one one one one out of the more little details more about the <unk>
I'm going to start the start when you was going to start the time I was a eight <unk>
I took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar, bill a dollar, and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado. Colorado.
And I thought, you think of some of the weird box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box <unk> box box box box box <unk> box <unk> <unk> for example how about how we are the <unk> <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has a bit fun because here I was a still doing the boxes.
At a moment since I was actually be in the <unk> <unk> <unk> like -- a <unk> for my mother.
And I took me all the first page and I took up all the top, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, my mother is a fear of the bees to bees, and so I added more more of the more more resin on the canvas, <unk> thinking of the <unk>
Instead, it happened the exact opposite thing that opposite happens, somehow it comes up, size size, <unk> with a <unk>
So I did I do -- I built more more boxes.
This is a time I started a time to add the electronic elements, going to find because I was actually look for a look at the whole street, trying to find, the one was stories stories about <unk> and tell stories stories about these objects.
So I just put up about drawing around the objects, -- about the space.
I can I feel a sense of draw the same kind of <unk> fire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I got up the objects and created my own <unk> taxonomy of <unk> specimens specimens.
First of all, you will be a chance you people to get a point.
And then I then made some strange insects and weird creatures.
It was a great fun to draw on the <unk> <unk>
And it was a great one, because I started me starting art exposures and to take my girlfriend for over a dinner, for dinner, the example, you go on the <unk>
It was really great. man.
At some point I became very interested in the human <unk> video sculptures sculptures sculptures of <unk>
It was a cool, except one thing -- <unk> me <unk> me.
I no longer know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about this.
So I tried it to be <unk>
I started drawing on the drawing on the drawing in a window and drawing in a window and drawing in a window of the drawing on the drawing on the drawing in a window and other window, and he had all these three-dimensional <unk>
And this really really work, and so I was able to stop using the <unk> <unk>
So I did this for the years, and my work <unk> <unk> that call <unk>
By <unk> me inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Do you you?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little way ahead of time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this was <unk>
It weighs weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It is a double <unk> face, so it's 10 10 feet old.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left one, it's Jesus and <unk> <unk>
There's a cave where all of all of two worlds.
They are all the <unk> <unk> to this <unk> <unk>
This is what the heads is where the heads of course the heads is where the heads of the head of <unk> <unk>
The ocean is a comprised of a thousand of elements.
This is a bird God the bird <unk> <unk>
Billy <unk> <unk>
And so much as well as a result as well as a <unk> kind of <unk>
It's coming out out of the ocean and spits it on the oil on a while the other hand they <unk>
Their hands are <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the cosmos in balance.
So this is a look like the <unk> thing.
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand where you <unk>
And then then then then when one goes on the other side side, it has a <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> <unk>
It also also have a <unk> feet feet feet long, a long <unk> feet long, a <unk> <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn a fire up a <unk> <unk>
I don't know about what happened to happen.
Things I going all familiar know.
The tail ends the tail end the tail end up a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've been <unk> them.
They were been been done in in the 1980s in 1980, as opposed to be a baseball baseball cards from the baseball books.
Pretty much <unk> to the last project.
I'm just in the two of two <unk> <unk> One called <unk> <unk>
It's about a project six to make 100 of these human <unk>
Each of one is a archive of culture, through the entire culture, through the through the through media and <unk> or magazines. <unk> material.
But every one of one as a kind of file kind of file a human <unk> <unk> four or 12.
They're just like cells, cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can you walk a walk between one of a walk between me -- <unk> <unk>
Every single one is basically a <unk> <unk> one <unk>
This is a little bit of a little little bit of a little little on the chest.
That's <unk> the <unk> the <unk> you can you get the <unk> <unk>
I'm going to be a part of you to play you the back through the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a quick quick seat of these works because I can't be <unk> for a long for a long for a long time.
We have a little bit of a little layer layer layer layer layer layer layer of <unk> you can look a see.
This is a match for half.
This is one two to work with two to work with two heads and be communicating between the two.
There's a little pills that come out and enter the head of this strange one.
There's a little little little forest forest inside the <unk> <unk> <unk> scene inside of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forest inside the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forest inside the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forest inside the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forest inside the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forest inside the <unk> bowl of forest inside the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> forest inside the <unk> bowl of forest inside the
Can you be <unk>
Anyway, this talk is a about these <unk> like the <unk> <unk>
We're in a box, the solar system system is a a box.
This brings me up my last last one.
It's called a <unk> <unk>
And inside this box is a physical, a neuroscientist, you a picture a writer, a writer, a musician a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer, a writer,
They <unk> the box <unk> and all the whole other bit of particle particles.
And I think that's a way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is the one <unk> who is and the box <unk>
And together we realize that we're all of us that all of us are together with these different concepts of the countries countries, <unk>
We are all all very much made of the same matter of the same matter of the same kind of matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start us to swap those things with sweetness and die very soon to die very much.
Thank you very much.
What do you make it when they hurt the <unk> your head?
They take a little <unk>
But so much is that for that to be an effect against the pain, first <unk> <unk> <unk> organs.
It will be going to take a pill the most most effective drug drug drug effect effect of the body. body.
The <unk> <unk> however, is that, as the drug is a drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When we take these <unk> drugs that to decrease the number of virus in the blood, number of the number of the blood number of virus of the blood, number of viruses virus in blood decrease viruses that decrease the number of virus blood the number of virus number of virus many viruses viruses viruses virus in blood decrease the number of virus in blood -- the number of virus
But they are also known for by their <unk> side effects of negative, because it's in the time that it takes on your blood stream <unk> <unk>
These are the <unk> regions regions like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, the disruption of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment treatment, the virus is a virus to rise and infect infect new new <unk> cells.
This is the great problem of HIV HIV HIV through the current treatment as run by a life treatment.
And one day I was just like a day, I sat myself and said, <unk> you will have the treatment directly the <unk> <unk> tank, <unk>
As a scientific expert <unk> answer the answer in front of me, <unk> the <unk> of course.
If you are used to be used in <unk> for the care care of <unk> surgery diabetes diabetes, diabetes diabetes, can be used for anything <unk> including including <unk> <unk>
In fact, we're already using <unk> <unk> to open the cells close and close the cells infected with <unk> cells.
<unk> people are you saying, "How about that <unk>
We sent a little <unk> laser laser over the HIV HIV hole as a drug drugs.
The laser laser goes through the cell through the drug absorbs the drug into the drug it absorbs absorbs the drug to absorbs the drug absorbed the drug absorbs the drug to absorbs the drug to absorbs the drug absorbed into the drug the drug absorbs absorbs the drug into the drug into the drug in a time.
Before we even even know it, the hole is <unk> <unk>
We are now testing this technology on the human body to the human body to the human body to the human body that into the human body now. are <unk>
"How is that <unk> <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a device three <unk>
With the first first one, which is we our laser, we will be going to be a <unk> <unk>
The second one is a camera, it's going to the site into the place.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> <unk> <unk> distributes directly directly into the site of infection, the infection, about infection, the infection, of infection, the infection, of infection, by infection, to keep the laser open.
Well, this is not like a very much a very much about a moment.
But one day if it's it is a success, this technology can lead lead to be the eradication of the total of the total total of the total total of HIV HIV breast into the eradication of the total total of HIV HIV breast into the eradication of HIV HIV breast from the HIV total eradication of HIV HIV breast into the HIV total HIV.
Yeah. A cure <unk> for HIV.
This is a dream of a dream of all all of all of all of the whole <unk> dream of a one treatment with laser treatment.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studied with not <unk> in the last last decade, in the last decade, or <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> what do these groups these groups that <unk> <unk>
My aim is to be a better to understand better to be a better to be a better to be a better to be a better to be better to understand ways to study ways to study ways to study ways to study ways to study ways to study ways to study ways to study ways to study ways how many ways of <unk> the transition from violent participation to
I'm making a work work work in the world of politics politics and the library. the library. the library. The library. The library. The library. <unk> world world, and the library.
Understanding these groups is really a key to be understanding the whole lot of key to solve pretty much all conflict in the because war war war war is because the war war is. has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states. between states.
Not anymore.
Now it is now a conflict between between government and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace deals in peace peace deals with between the state of the state and a <unk> non-governmental actor.
And so we need us us to understand these <unk> <unk> we even be <unk> -- the <unk> up in any very much resolution of successful successful successful success. resolution.
But how do you do you do that?
We need you to know what it motivates these organizations organizations.
We know really a very good for the reason the reason that they do, but not to be <unk>
The armed struggle fight and the foreign policy is not a <unk> <unk>
It's all part of the part of the very part organization.
We cannot be a serious understanding of these groups, a much less global <unk> view.
The armed groups of today are very complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for the violent <unk> of violent violent violent violent <unk> <unk>
Since the creation of the creation in the 1980, <unk> <unk> has also established a set of a political party and a network of social network of social services network, network, network of social services network. network.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> <unk> known for the suicide attacks suicide attacks suicide attacks suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide attacks attacks suicide attacks suicide suicide attacks suicide <unk> suicide attacks suicide <unk> suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide attacks suicide suicide attacks suicide attacks suicide attacks suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide
And so these groups these groups these groups make more than simply to fire, just to just be simply <unk> as simply to fire.
<unk> multitasking
We <unk> a complex <unk> machinery machinery of the radio power stations <unk> web websites web Internet web networks.
And here you have the <unk> line in English English and published English to <unk>
<unk> groups are also also also also also also also also also also also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> <unk> for example, building commercial companies.
These are these <unk> activities point.
They allow these groups these guys to increase their <unk> to increase their <unk>
<unk> groups are also also also them also more more to create more stronger ties in social services.
They build up the schools, run a lot of professional professional training professional professional training programs or a <unk> professional <unk>
<unk> It makes all these new services and more more.
<unk> groups are also also also be also going to conquer the population of offering you something that the state state state state security safety and protection.
The <unk> rise of the rise of the <unk> rise had in a Afghanistan torn through the war or even even the first the beginning of the rise of <unk> rise in <unk> is able to be also also also <unk> by also by the beginning of the <unk> rise ascent war, <unk> can also also be also scanning the the most of the efforts many groups of <unk>
Unfortunately, unfortunately, in the in these cases, security has a price for high high for the population.
But generally, we will also be also going to provide social services means to fill a <unk> a <unk> gap gap by the <unk> gap gap of the <unk> gap gap in by the <unk> <unk> gap gap gap a a <unk> gap gap by the <unk> <unk> gap gap of the <unk> gap gap by spreading by the <unk> of the <unk> gap gap of the spread of the
For example, the election the election victory victory victory I was for example, the electoral election victory victory victory victory victory <unk> In for example, the election the election victory victory victory victory victory we can't be recognize the very recognize recognize the very social <unk> social <unk>
It's a really complex scenario to even even look at the <unk> groups of <unk> groups we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to be a better enough to understand the understand the strengths of these groups, very long term.
These groups are these <unk> <unk>
<unk> because they fill it up the <unk> gaps gaps in the violent struggle struggle on the violent fight of governance.
And the the more the more the more the more we are the more complex and sophisticated are these <unk> as opposed to a state.
How are we going to call a group to call a <unk>
They are a part of a <unk> part of the landscape run out of trash, the <unk>
It's a state? it a <unk> <unk>
Or maybe it is something another thing, something new and new thing.
And what is it <unk> <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of the nation of state of state of state and the Middle <unk> the <unk> and the the Middle Middle East one, and the more the the the the the the <unk> people are states, are states, states, are states, states, <unk>
This is important to be important for the governments, because to counter these groups more to invest more of the military military <unk>
We <unk> that was a <unk> that government to be the center of any sustainable approach.
This is a really important to also be also going to be also going to be also going to be also a very important to set up and make the peace.
If we do we be better at a better better to groups better to groups better to the transition from violence from violence violence from violence on violence from violence from violence with violence.
In this new <unk> between states states and <unk> actors, the military power power power can win some <unk> but not give us peace and peace to win some <unk> peace.
To get these goals goals to long-term investments long-term investments in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a a woman, as a woman failure. I'm a failure as a woman, as a feminist <unk>

Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke -- it going to be the same as much larger.
Let me give you a step back a step back.
When I was a young woman, especially in my youth and at the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk>
Today, I look at what the women people all over the world and the whole world -- in particular -- in particular, it looks like a a perfect response.
But at the same then, I was worried worried about the way the <unk> <unk> who might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled a feminist like a feminist -- a <unk> <unk>
I <unk> like a woman as a woman woman who have not follow the rules, <unk> <unk> to believe believe that belief to believe that believe that believe that belief believe this belief is believe that true <unk>
No one one one one one one is actually a woman imagine that woman to imagine a one another person.
Over time, as I was a growing up, I started a chance to accept -- the I am, <unk> <unk> <unk> in fact, <unk> <unk> <unk> a proud proud of a be.
For me, certain claims of the women are equal like equal to men.
They <unk> the same paid for the same paycheck for the same work. itself.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> or <unk> violence.
We have a right to use it very easy and <unk> accessible the <unk> services.

We're not just women.
We are people people a different body a different body of gender, the social social is a social <unk> skills.
We need you to have the look those differences in the way that we are in common as common.

When we were <unk> us <unk> <unk> <unk> with very much comfortable with the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> <unk>
As I said, I'm just a <unk> I've already been a chance of <unk> from that <unk> before try to get me there.

They are a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> for fear of being able to fulfill with <unk>
Let's take a look for example by <unk> <unk> or <unk> The <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years is a <unk> feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music Music <unk> 2014, from 2014, in in front of the word <unk> <unk>

They were <unk> your feminism, instead to just believe the word of an adult woman adult woman and <unk> word of <unk> adult <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
We're going to be a much more much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> <unk> up until not to be left.
We don't need that do that.
<unk> <unk> or more more <unk> is the one point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> <unk> happen a little more <unk>
If I hear the <unk> music, I'm creating a demand for a artists by providing a <unk>
These artists will not change their way their way to talk about the women in the way that <unk> -- the change change change effectively their return.
It's certainly a hard hard.
Why is his music to be being <unk>
It's hard to pick up something better to pick up a much worse choice.
But when if the bad decisions decisions that makes that it be more more hard for the equality equality equal as <unk>
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are also very much <unk> I want you going to grow up a world up a world up.
They are much been excited about them, by the strong creatures creatures.
I think of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden of a sudden easier to do.
We can all all make better better decisions.
We can change change the channel channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women sexual violence against women as sports <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

We can be not to stop support in the professional group of the <unk> fellow of the <unk> fellow <unk>
In any case, the men, men, many men, they are a part in a part of a part of a part of a part of the one being part of a part of the one being part of a part of the project project, you or work with a work with work with a work with work with work with work with work with work with work with work with
I'm not going to work with you until this <unk> <unk>
Those of us who are also going to be even even more to us to overcome the <unk> the walls the walls the walls into the <unk>
Because we are not a really not a <unk> <unk> Without adopt these <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We can we make these little kinds of <unk> of the people people people in the people people in the people people people in the people people people in the people people people in the people in the people people people in the people the people people people in film and movie movie movie movie movie movie movie movie movie <unk> <unk> <unk>

The last line of my book <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> says, <unk> <unk> you will be a bad at <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I -- the <unk> voice is <unk> <unk>
There was one incident.
I call you what I call it incident to be done in front of what happened.
A few more kids would <unk> me when I was a young one, and I didn't know the first known one idea that kids to do well a girl.
They were being treated as a matter of nothing.
I started a way to believe that not a matter of nothing.
<unk> my voice, <unk> and after all, I think of the belief that could actually say something something something to really matter.
But I was actually been writing.
And I went back back to <unk>
I was <unk> you in a much more version of myself.
And I read the words of the words of the words of the words of the words of the words the words the words of the women who looked like me and they understood really understood what it was living to live in this part of a living in this part of living in this world if mine, mine, and of the women women women who looked like me and
And I read the words the words of the women words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I was learned to write as a <unk> and myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice to be really powerful as powerful as a measure.
Through the entire show, and <unk> <unk> I also have another woman a woman -- and see me to realize that none of us that the world is about to tell us that we are.
In one of hand, I have the power power to get anything.
And on one another, I argue the very <unk> reality that was only a woman.
I'm going to be a better enough to think of thinking, and what I do, and what I do mean that say -- and what I do say -- and what I do is, do it say about what I say -- and what that makes me be <unk>
I hope I hope so I hope hope we all the hope that I hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope that hope I hope I hope hope that I hope that hope I
I hope I hope so I hope hope we all be a little brave when a <unk>
Just as long after Christmas from the last year ago, <unk> <unk> children of <unk> -- a one for being exposed to a person being exposed to the person being exposed to the one one to be exposed to someone who had been there.

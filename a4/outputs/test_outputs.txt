You know what I do is to write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as <unk> or <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into a place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle years, at the middle school, in <unk> <unk> where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom of kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom of the operating room.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1960s. I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> we have never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring it to that man that I know you already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to stand with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> from their family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it
It's something we knew about how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box, and it was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, and it had become a circle -- and that epiphany of which I told them was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this.
It also needs -- needs to -- needs love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans aren't separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can <unk> I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them to me around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even know that it was a <unk> in another <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or you break the ice pyramid.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and they hold up to the end, while others can't afford it more and <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
And as a <unk> melts, I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestry, knowing that in these unique moments there exist in that way, and they won't have to be going to exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of your way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are a iceberg that photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's very unlikely to get to witness a <unk> <unk>
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single baby, a baby. Okay.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of conception I won't pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll come back to them later.
In my activity to make two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> the anatomy -- that is to say, from human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluid, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that works in my job is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> to people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social rules.
I've been working on, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than average.
And I've been working with a lot of other people with sex sex, individuals whose physical physicist doesn't fit in male and female <unk>
At <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopt many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having an sex that is not <unk> in the common forms or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is whose <unk> gene of the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> which will become <unk>
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops in the end of a event typically female.
When I <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a <unk>
What's important to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know their structure -- I think, I think, is a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the brain more exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> born and raised as a <unk> I had girlfriend, and she had sex with her, he had a life like a kid and he had just figured out he had <unk> and a <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at age 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, have tissue tissue wrapped wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgeries is not to be able to enjoy a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they were <unk> to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is having a <unk> identity, <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
This is a simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very strong ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that you have kids who are born like two people in a body.
The recent recent case is last year with the African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What a test is going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no one test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more you go through the science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought of these categories -- we thought they were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories.
And not only of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> ground.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we find it in science we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today on the public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you would put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved not yet.
If he stopped moving to <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with a dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be greeted by someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, to <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to me that he gets nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we thought about.
They get rid of the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find myself every single watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The Parents <unk> were to me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they did -- it was a <unk> concept, and they would plug it with another thing that was radical and beautiful and kept it for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our parents, our parents, <unk> was the idea of <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that there was political power for the law of blood from the grandfather to the father and then to the son, etc.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replace it by a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of common and not differences in the <unk> that was very radical.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from the ideological explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power that was transmitted by a vague idea of the birth of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at you, for example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were spreading us the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk>
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, the people of color that <unk> the <unk> <unk> about the difference difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start wondering why we hold certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> before anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they were supposed to have sex with sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me and that I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures -- the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: was was born on the March March of 1980.
For the only fact that Mary was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right as Henry -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, to virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
TS: For your part, he doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in every states, for example.
Henry can be married in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So you still have <unk> categories that are still <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went through so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of how to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is going to be <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught up in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man -- no one has to have chromosome and get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make a test test for people.
But this is also very strange because the story that I told you to the beginning of <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I will admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart <unk> decisions about their sexual relationships that people in 40 I know.
So how do you put in practice the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is it seems to be very important that America is going to go through this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they are willing to belong to a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth twins to then pick up their <unk>
But when the phone asked her the <unk> was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political seekers instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people who are <unk> to change because of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, I want to say I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if people are thinking about a group.
Since years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sex difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism -- I was interested in feminism -- I was considered to wonder like <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, more than there is something women in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the owners were very aware to find the way to protect people because of the state, it's possible that there are more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we get democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more on relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect man, let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think of where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily get <unk> to the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just <unk> by buildings on apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments could be owners, and that the other half is still not <unk> to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building distractions at construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a new place to build a whole new apartments building a whole new apartment building, and when the rules of that place we would build the construction instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments, new areas of new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people will come up with their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following elections of the following <unk> <unk> <unk> they settled on with a platform in which we had <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under the most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and sing all the current residents of apartments.
We spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like rules for <unk> and they usually are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we came together in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> and said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to be there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covered over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world's <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city where you could go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And it also shapes new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them who will help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a few thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> the Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress in favor of this <unk> <unk> <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> all the <unk> the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 was passed over again in other voting and <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting <unk> at the age of 21, a <unk> <unk> of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators and to allow them to operate under a external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last sentence for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've figured out is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that would want to go through the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are unwed mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, there are sometimes even children who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friend <unk> asked me to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is in it, I'm going to make a confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, and he was recently photographing and published in my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know <unk> people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Being from my size?
I love color to you?
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
So going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I figured it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know about the woman who walks for TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger man.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you will also give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you're wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me it seems to play the <unk> or I remind you to his little seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style. It's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again, when people were approaching me this week simply because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart, and I look at it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive side.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain in this scale?
Some of them were <unk> by one of these ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both of them -- at the same time.
It's not that each other <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We can play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
One of the intuition that you may have developed with the day of the years is that one thing that says that one thing can be only at one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and didn't do it very well, and it always was <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar in the parking lot, I taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things will not allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things really strange -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of a few years ago -- you need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit it to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk> <unk>
I don't find the reason why it didn't.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a little bit of metal, which is a springboard and a springboard and supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole very <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap -- but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of things, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want to do those things, because I don't want to do it, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues for inanimate objects are not just people, and it's also the light that happens and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights -- then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then you put it to a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as well.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way that <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth soft, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't have to take it at the same time -- something that happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing -- and you don't mean at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time these same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which it turns out that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little metal and you are.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you just too?
I mean, it's my logic that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in many places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act on your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when you put it up, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal still followed in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories from why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than it shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look at all the museums there.
There's the gallery, <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the room.
Are you going to go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixel up.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixel in the end.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to <unk>
I went and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is going to hit a <unk> with a <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get more deep at depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll actually see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we will quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and it really takes it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night, I think I'd never seen it that before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite function.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that day.
You can online create their own museum, create their own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The power of the <unk> -- we just make one place there.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things are really not coming from Google.
No, in my mind, even though I don't come from museums.
Maybe it shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your art work, and it's represented online.
And the big question that makes me today is: "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something I'll show you.
Think of it is a <unk> <unk>
In our lab we call it technical design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian <unk> all the children in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that something very interesting is that has happened very interesting in the last two decades.
Now sometime ago, if you wanted to win a year by Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good car and a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- you won the race.
This is what it is -- in engineering, we have a real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're becoming computers in the air.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, during <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it is like almost all of the atoms that are existing and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end of the hammer took the hammer and he threw him down the Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup the World Cup in Italy that Italy won the World Cup in Italy that Italy won the world.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity in the web.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
And then there are people out there and there are <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a call fast and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> to the center.
There you see the great summit.
The next day they were all at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do it just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but what we use and we consume.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash into its change by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year to tag what they were -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a tag on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that had not existed before.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that I dropped not disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that I <unk> one day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is actually <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and said to us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in the architecture.
And the question was, how technology can be, the new technology will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates a <unk> water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels fall on, you can write on them, show patterns, show patterns, images.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you get up to it you can get up to you that you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've got it, but when it's low almost all the architecture goes down.
Here's how it works.
You see the <unk> people in the way that happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened at night when all of the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because how to interact there was a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in the water, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always we think about how people will give us our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to prove that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel -- which changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
This is a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, in which what changes is light, not the position of the Pacific.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can close, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet camp, the star of the New York City star and the <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as a entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can make all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm as the calf <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will be <unk> we can move from the digital world to be able to move from the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or the emissions of CO2. How to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it was covered in the Pacific.
You can move inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom -- to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> in the night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> by more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or might you like to be in better ways, will be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that we were more excited about.
What would you do -- if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people do you <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's really good.
How many would you want memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference. But I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great minister of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "No biology makes sense of <unk>
But if effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at a end, is of course that we are more interested in it.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin using to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of it.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- <unk> -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm warm -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort on their part.
It's really like a fast pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> into the way.
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe <unk>
In this vast undersea symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single <unk> and a single human life, a small note.
That's us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope that you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental to me in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, every cell is simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two <unk> cells.
But when diarrheal organisms, things start to change.
It goes into scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I was going on, every time I was going on, I had more <unk>
I was going to understand the feelings of George <unk> who are still in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your door <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of it, you find a magnificent <unk> of clothes.
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
And he says, "Okay, George "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to give us healthy people.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to happen to the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are kind of like <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden into the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily cause longevity.
They won't necessarily benefit the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish used to <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does it mean when we look at what's going on in evolution and if you go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look at the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we were adapting to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it is no longer possible to have the sense of isolation for us to happen.
A second possibility is that you create an evolution of the traditional kind of evolution of the form of traditional nature.
And the argument here would tell that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when as a kind of <unk> planets that are distant planets, they're going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce the evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a more <unk> intriguing and scary possibility.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and they selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it takes to the individual and family level.
So think about it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex from their <unk> but in your own body to do the genetic gene to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes for eliminating diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and he sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 dollars, and on a week.
Not much of us to make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more to the reach of everyone.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine <unk> in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two small <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes -- reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease -- is going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a faster muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in <unk> conditions -- this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of prior to <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take a hundred thousand years old, and we can go back to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful society.
Or, let's choose to selectively selectively <unk> we want some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what it might be, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk to the flight.
So he immediately looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already taken the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
We took the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then three words said ...
The three words are more likely to have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight car.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes at a second.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get and I didn't have I did, all the fences I wanted to have and have never been <unk>
As I was thinking about that, then I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to improve all of what I did.
But in my humanity as I also give my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock goes on, <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the sense of, Wow, it's not scary.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point I understood by connecting those two points -- that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
<unk> gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift that was the ability to look at the future and come back and live differently.
You guys are flying up today, the challenge to you to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and for please not so -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is the thing that <unk> who are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
A day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> has total paralysis of all.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and his father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk about Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second second, it's not that I see Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are running with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed up a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I stood up with her brother and his father there at that very moment, <unk> "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his artwork again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inside cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which have a technology that has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- draw on that and register the negative space.
So they go around with art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot later, after a lot of organization and very much move things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One is, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine to be able to <unk> it could be a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage behind, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we would do something totally stupid and that when they were <unk> would have taken the squares off the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> <unk> ride. My son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun <unk> that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, the <unk> we set it up on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- -- we published the code -- we published the software code, the software is low in free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There is no company that says, "No."
There are no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate with only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming games at night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside of the hospital.
And he started drawing for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine, what the feeling was in the <unk>
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I would get me out there so I could get it out there.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure out, and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> in urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want we all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time as a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days of a day eating this fun -- a lot of fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations looking terrible at the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully analyzing them in a way that looked useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of ear, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of 2011.
What had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy copyright rights.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would never have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing, advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been sitting in some horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could be done for something that is so difficult to get into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try to do a film of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is all of the top at the bottom of the beginning -- it has some images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes out before the title of the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in film to <unk>
And so the film is exploring this whole idea. <unk> <unk> is what? It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark on the title, but we're going to make sure that we would take up all the categories that we could in the film.
You may get a shoe and then you get the most cool shoe you've ever met.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest <unk> never <unk> the best drink that you've heard <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> <unk> and we actually showed the full process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help them make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One million and a half <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them, but it certainly is going to be worth to convince a couple of big devices.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be difficult for the film or to be I?
JK: That's both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this is one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
And no one had nothing to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything to this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible as possible, to make so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media, and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that appeared.
I like your <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> as the last biggest line is probably the last thing.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency day --  like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this very rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father stood up in some lie -- and that's him looking at him as he used to <unk> said, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency, wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized I would have to go through my mind, I would have to take out the way to be able to go and go to the companies with all my team.
So what I started to figure out suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big, big, massive movies, and others that make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who do big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically <unk> at the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "You're good for this <unk>
You ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you that you were <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look at that.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look.
Karen Frank: We are a little bit of a little bit.
<unk> the little kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are more well a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind you to tell people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you get in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you fresh for the better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
They are things like those who were <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my <unk>
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Volunteer: reviving the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray and things like this.
They usually wear accessories like <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Some of the <unk> in part of the <unk> in part of the <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my little sector, that's my <unk>
Man 4: My brand is all of the <unk> because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be mark, I mean, I often lie on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape how to see the world.
A: <unk>
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that <unk> as the people around you, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case they come in and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this the best day in my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things -- I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me of the <unk> for what is that for us?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: Yes.  Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a brand <unk>
They were doing very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I think some companies are only going to lie in one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be a lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them a little bit of a little bit positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and brands -- those things that have gone and come and come up with a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: A brand <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your identity and you get your people's head, your brand, what would be?
Are you a <unk> attribute -- you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you more well a attribute <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as being playful like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more about attribute <unk>
You're conscious and sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
Are you <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, you would not have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use MRI to identify the <unk> to identify the language centers in the brain so much for movie marketing for movies.
We went to San Paulo where we have banned <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are going into the way in schools with market problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was early in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talked about to talk about to their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take a <unk> if you take risks that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get to the people of that pushing it to failure.
I think when you train your employees in the averse to the risk of the risk to be preparing the entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear into a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to stop transparency.
More than not a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who had bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of the transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my health for TED on the year.
The idea behind the so-called <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Her biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
<unk> boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus of Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray, box <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes. These control systems.
And that struck us attention, and we started an experiment in which we would <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they were very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a <unk> rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it is effectively working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than the goal would soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two plastic pumps -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
You know, all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much they did the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It's pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning, was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and <unk> data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world, with potential real world.
We need theories about avoiding which we can pass or <unk>
To reach out to goals, you remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a half valuable, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I met them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that a mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the credit engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started investigating scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had with my hands.
So I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets for <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really looked at me.
That's the grey box, and the top is the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of the sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and providing <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera gets <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not do fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the great steam turbine goes down speed, you have to open <unk> <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can see bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And they didn't have the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk> plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, <unk>
There is one itself, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can lead to you and give <unk> abilities, or another thing that makes users from chairs chairs.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also increasing its speed, and help you, for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not an idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a 45 kilos, and it's going to be <unk> to get more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds of weather ground for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running a big <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs chairs of wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people who are chairs of wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage in the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population of the population that goes down very quickly.
Her single option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are a little bit of batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and the knees and make it forward with this very soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom is <unk>
In a fraction of second, I lost a whole feeling and all of the baby <unk> down.
Little time later, a doctor came to my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never go back to <unk>
That was about 19 years ago.
So my stole to the last bit of hope of my self.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs <unk> <unk> <unk> and even ride a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only of soldiers, but for all the users of chairs of <unk> to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimps, their very close kin.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done much emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the country.
The trade trade and deforestation make you can't fill or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have sex and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, of behavioral interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo, Bonobo sees the roots very <unk> same as the dance and the human eye.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of only <unk> videos.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't talk about football <unk>
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> it has <unk>
Just that I think in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common in bonobos as well as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young woman who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think, as it does, sometimes we played yourself, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a more and more difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these skills.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's get back to the ultimate capacity of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and human <unk> life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least the same appropriate play, you can be the moments in which it's the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as it <unk> creativity, friendship and <unk>
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, it was <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to reach the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with chemotherapy who certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came up to the captain and he asked her to go into and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a building in flames to save a live alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to be in the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire department -- that at that height of the <unk> and went to the fourth room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house treasures the treasures for the owner of the house where, as he was to expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> for the brave set of effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over what else was that someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman -- I'm a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room in this room who have achieved, or are for us to do -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you about this: <unk>
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in an dining room, a neighborhood park.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So he trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a big fan of a concrete block of concrete.
The first concrete blocks was built in <unk> with a very simple idea of modules that are cement in a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks for each person on the planet.
You don't have to be a engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> it made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block block of <unk> the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> aesthetic brick to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block that the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, one brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was only to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are being quiet to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists, and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they join through magnets together.
So you can't get place in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the way, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange is the <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits in it.
A blue one with a green one is producing light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse module that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
And we had this <unk> to create more impact and we have a piece of noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> us allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow or more slow -- you just spin this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a top-down collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to get ready to use bricks and use them to use.
<unk> sounds <unk> solar panels, it all must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light bulb work?
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the <unk> School designers who have no experience in engineering, only in wood and paper and said, "Give them something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> barrel here.
But hang on, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach for everybody.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world to <unk> inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking at engaging with the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I think the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in a environment that represents almost everything that we were supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members of the year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of listening to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a tree from Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a quote, but what you really look for is that someone has to have a lot of it when it is caught by snow, because he knows that it's not very good by putting fires when it's covered in a meter of snow.
How did it have to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I was spending a lot last year.
They realized the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something more -- that citizens are going to be <unk> on sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You take <unk>
When you do it, you put a name, in this case he got a <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a sleeping model.
It's a modest application.
It may be the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends into viral.
A responsible system for the city of <unk> City to see this application realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why you ask the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago ends up <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that will use it.
And this has spread out without <unk> and natural and natural <unk>
If you know a little bit about government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen.
The operating software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by normal channels would have taken at least two and over two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the moment has over two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days, and it spreads into viral form is a kind of shot shot from warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not like private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
It's not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, no <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications that are in their own communities.
They haven't given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that but they don't get <unk> it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics -- line up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that we give us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> which we do together because they can't <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy doesn't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- you remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way it would think about it will affect the way the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to pick up people so that they were <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care center, and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of your house, put a strong music and see if it's <unk>
And it worked. So at Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston has no telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They didn't make that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this actually comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to place, I found the cube of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening.
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to the government volunteer to society.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition technology in the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people are going to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
connected to the two people.
And I could have connected the government services to be necessary but your neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps the other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people have got it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will raise our values and our <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that that we have that is that we financed as something that is operating in our <unk> that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work -- we'll have to make the bureaucracy that the bureaucracy is sexy.
Because that's where the real job is going on.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the project of financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask ourselves, what world is we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they are going to have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to rethink the government function so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> only we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions in any channel at any same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem doesn't really care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They lay their hands into the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be wiping out a <unk> by taking away -- put a garbage cube that has a <unk> in it.
We certainly could have cleaned up those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are as a digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and the death row
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here have impact around the world.
On occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here we have seen fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in every conference in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was little, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and giving me a good hug.
I was so heavy that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I went back again and if I told him I know, I would leave it in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that there was 10 children.
My mother was the least of the 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get their time and your attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up a morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and he said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up in the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on -- "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "All right, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to talk about is you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you always are going to do the right while the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to talk about, is that I never want to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the countryside, in South rural -- I have a brother for a greater year and a sister a little bit lower.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed us from my sister and me and we went out for the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You go, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> you get the <unk> and you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I stood up with the <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> you tell all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this was spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I say it's a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others who don't really see it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all her grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related diseases of alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in probation.
And this mass incarceration, in my view, has changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so many despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison or parole.
In the urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore to 60 to 60 percent of all young people in jail are in prison or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is not <unk>
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our problems.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some great developments curious about this.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, I will get care of rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of male male population has lost the right to the vote.
And if we projected it over the next 10 years the level of rights to be as high as it was before they did, the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world that was sentencing to <unk> children to die in prison.
We have in this country in prison for children, without a chance of getting out.
Right now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They took people in the death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, we have taught us that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die for the crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one who is innocent and liberated from the death row of death.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation would never allow you to ever fly airplanes if in every nine to <unk> you have to be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I'm talking about slavery to you.
I'm talking about terrorism, the little thing that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what they defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our own history, for the first time with terrorism.
They ask me to say, <unk> <unk> we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we fall with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome our segregation without the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's okay to listen to what they would be.
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
<unk> could never be here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There is no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and <unk> we put the people."
<unk> about this.
How are we going to be in a world where a nation like Germany, went to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these questions that are so difficult, the positive things and wonderful are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate two things.
lately we've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never get to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so rational, so <unk> to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, with creativity. It comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but it's also the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will for being on despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED has <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to the injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, as a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women would get together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what do she are going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let me tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to be doomed to help them.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty <unk>
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to finish the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got a finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is higher to the worst that we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't believe it, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills the other is not that it's a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's how it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> not we judge for our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the rich, powerful and <unk> but because of the way they treat poor people, the <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, which has been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night I was awake for God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a client from 14 a little, black <unk>
I began to work on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my old black client was treated as a <unk> privileged <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there had been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there are no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking of that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court by this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was really feeling <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And I finally went down the car I was walking to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man, which was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He's like, "This is you <unk> I said yes.
And then I walked up and <unk> me.
And I get rid of the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When the judge came in, he saw me saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> <unk>
People started getting there. Everyone was <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors -- <unk> <unk>
Suddenly not knowing how, the room was full of people. All mad because we talked about races, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> who was going and <unk>
I looked through the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black faces came in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood stood up to the <unk> I looked at me and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this young audiences to tell this young woman to keep her sight in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you realize that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is bound to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your view on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, of this community, to help in your terms, to do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close now.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which it will be a <unk> effort to make the funds that are spent today in political policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, over the next five years, one billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of homicide cases, not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to be able to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think this is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war to the drugs.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> chain to steal a bicycle in small crimes against the property, instead of making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of the punishment is nothing about anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you been excited today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop of all of that data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So from a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices, you give us negative news, the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, is not surprising to be <unk>
It doesn't surprise that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction species -- the scarcity of water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and in the long run, we just left them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income for inflation -- all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Furthermore, the cost of food, of the electricity, of transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people were <unk>
And we continue to get more and higher expectations as well.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, mobile conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So let's find a lot of this technology, and then again, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we had in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile thing you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time in war and peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the resulting end computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the great challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing computing sensors and networks, and the robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, our fuel and the food, the digital medicine and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Does it play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that it's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon Three in the <unk> 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum metal was the most valuable metal of the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal <unk>
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made of aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 energy <unk> every <unk> minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the American parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a <unk> for hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars for water.
You remember when Carl Sagan has pointed the Voyager Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater saltwater -- two percent is ice, and we fought the water <unk> of the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes, <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on a day of any source, saltwater, water, water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola ends up, which will make a major proof of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which I'm going to be, Coca-Cola is the <unk> in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation for this technology that is currently there.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get 70 percent penetration in the end of the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever seen.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video <unk> images, libraries of books and music, technology -- <unk> diagnostic technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when you show the applications of the health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device that you talk about, and because it has <unk> you can get rid of blood of the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there's <unk> of health workers.
When this device was <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the health and the first place, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
So we've just happened to get a quarter billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world for education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you get to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you want? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can us give us three more million members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the critic, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What do you do? These 3,000 million?
And if they're <unk> we can't afford it.
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by their passion with a goal of course, they can do things that were <unk> things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you have heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've been playing with this college teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it has been shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the innovative passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are going to be <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades of extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They can actually be fish.
And they described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very much until the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos, and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There was <unk> of about 20 millimeters -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, and so he became more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had declined in half.
They went to five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> it started in <unk> Europe conducted a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose the countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite simply, was called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea of China <unk> and, especially in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny <unk> which are fish from coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing set.
The bottom of being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead.
They don't <unk> them because they were dead.
We captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of debris is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But it doesn't have <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't recall it.
I was able to start the start starting to start a new level, without remembering what was there.
So if you look at this something like this.
On the axis of it, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time, changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the kind of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> remains.
And that, in big measure, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when wealthy societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a kind of synonymous with great fish.
They become unusual because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a standard way before they would expect it to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain as a captain as a captain of such a lot of fish in this area can't be used, or usually they don't use the science of the fishing scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't think of because the starting point has been running, it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a marine protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do you connect with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to Cameron, <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, they come into a part of our global culture.
Anybody can do it very famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a small percentage gets <unk> gets lots of <unk> and he makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things -- creators of trends, communities and factor of surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the popularity of the last summer.
<unk> was not saying a viral video.
I just wanted to share a bow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this story that I would tell you about the video to the popular.
The creators like Jimmy <unk> are showing us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.  You all want to go on the end of a week, the weekend   <unk> Friday. I could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday Friday at night.
Well, he took <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators take a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this big community of people who shares this big inner joke then starts to talk about that and to do things.
And now there are 10,000 people on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon of <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats seeing the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old one.
And then they did international did.
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form a part.
Because it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Black <unk>
What script could have been written by this situation?
In a world where you get two days of video -- only the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> to <unk> in New York City, I admit I didn't really interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular because of the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep the circular people properly <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million views and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we make in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The ability to trend creative communities, creative communities, totally unexpected, features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, where we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, only the current means of the current media, but it will be the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported on the only one and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long friends, I have now <unk>
They were <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I was doing it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old, when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to <unk> the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And then from a <unk> four years that challenges fiction, a boat slid into the sea sea of <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the managers, the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we were <unk> we would first take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast horizon, and empty countries.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the dying dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and he died, to finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I did, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> and the population is comprised of immigrants here.
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence I was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the English snippets were <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car line, working six days -- <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in IT <unk> from the <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, not mind what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> <unk> was always a second hand.
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me was <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares are starting to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> boys in between two worlds.
They looked up subsidies and <unk>
They created centers.
I lived in online worlds.
In one, it was the classical <unk> student relentless with what <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in the other lives of <unk> tragically, by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer who chose the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges, not <unk>
So <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and activist and activist -- invited to talk about sites that I had never heard, and in homes that she would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the happy life of life in a suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
Honey has never been an option.
<unk> he said, "and you don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly -- the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they were living in the frontier of possible.
And even though I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown -- a <unk> new thing on the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps out of my happy place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for whom the <unk> cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot pot that all <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she himself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't have been wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
And I looked through the <unk> in the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around with his <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't got it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The loss would have <unk> <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that to know?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> <unk> in every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to them and see them safe I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and put the sky.
We do it with airplanes.
At that time when we <unk> the great Prince warrior Indian warrior -- he had <unk> <unk> a rainbow and with a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
We now do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was able to get this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to enable magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this kind of technology piece was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since age 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
I collect the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is a <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In various moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but at that one of childhood, to those ideas that are coming from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me exciting.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And I really light your way into the subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy will be <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect of me is to create Indian content and in contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people were out of India, they know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over the millennia, in an old old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not have gone to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go out of the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of natural objects.
As a girl, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual we have to go out and in a chapter, and you get a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through and through <unk> reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves at a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature will be defined with technology and magic and technology will come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and children that sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a sign of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my scale of Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put a challenge to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when I need <unk> <unk> or any urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move the people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were moving from their homes, to take their pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they return to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of the attention and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video video.
We all have navigation navigation in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where conservation machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one was <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> for favor of <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and to the next few weeks to use your cell phone cell to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it at the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They might be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they are photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest by photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my <unk> <unk> but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me, photography was more than to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by press the <unk>
It was going to be like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist.
And despite it, it holds a level of his eyes.
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful time but with the common goal of keeping the level of his eyes.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be, but I always want it to be captured in a kind of a photograph.
You know, what you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what's the trick that makes it look like.
They are the details or the <unk>
I will make light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it comes to our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic as we think it's a realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was it.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a photo looks a realistic picture, I think they're the ones that don't even change the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But when I combine these pictures is very important to <unk> because otherwise something is wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are <unk> they must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come up with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of the different images with a perfect one.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff I think it's easier to create a place to find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made red the top of the top of the island of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to get a realistic result I think it takes planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then we need to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and it's very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
So please, if you can <unk>
This is a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you all the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as a lot of other people we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk>
Here's something strange here.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights off.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do you use technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve in which, let's say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
That doesn't say much.
But if you look at for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, and we would see a straight line.
But if something happens like this, it takes a <unk>
If the technology of transport is rapidly as fast as <unk> in the past one morning, we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But don't go through that rhythm.
There are no <unk> in the history of technological development in an <unk> growth, that every few years of magnitude progression of magnitude.
The question I want to do is -- look at these <unk> curves that we see is not for forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it will be a typical curve, I know like this until it comes to something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
On this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is what that new way that the world is <unk>
What new is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future happened in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years, because it all will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two and a half two and a half two and the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals coming around them.
So if we look at the way those chemicals are <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, there were about <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that had made them incorporate materials from the outside and the drops grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> it will be <unk> a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better than time to incorporate chemical <unk> more chemicals and more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but things became interesting when these drops has learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that script system seems to be remained stable since it evolved two and two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same <unk> system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here's 100 <unk> of dust that I try to hide the safety of the airport.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have it spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years old.
But then another big step happened in which things got very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form the cell communities.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were put together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community became more and more <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe in the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities from many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart, or the muscles of the brain, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than processing information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these microbial phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the structures that are responsible for <unk> and understanding the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit, because I knew the last time he knew and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these data processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the fact that the nervous system built these structures of information made enormous evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a very complicated idea of your head.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully by building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now go through periods similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video tape -- the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we would do before.
Now evolution can happen in length.
You saw the evolutionary evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The next few days the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that we work for <unk> would not be possible without recent states.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to translate it in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that makes something that you didn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is the evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the 1980s.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve.
We say, "Please computer -- you can run a hundred million instructions to <unk>
You could run these sequences of random instructions -- running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to <unk> to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk> numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that kids would have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of <unk> programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's put it again.
They were looking at some mutations here.
And it tries to get new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that orders numbers in absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're programs much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are strange dark programs.
But does the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he goes, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design processes for this.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand the whole choices there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so I could run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think it'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to allow me to give you a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat my talk, we talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about getting <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and hope that many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> that we were going to have 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without <unk> and that whatever you try to do to the first base base -- not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three 10.
You know what they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great Plains, <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody from 10 yards <unk> I get down four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player from the League <unk> of <unk> in the top of 400 hits in a regular season.
Now I would bring this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are attending a surgeon who has a record record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and a dear one, has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family doctor gives it to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think is that the average of hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I included, with the mandate <unk>
You never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a storyteller.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood <unk>
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the New York City Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my middle class -- <unk> the origin and the work -- the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> and the <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the medical school with the impression that if they were <unk> everything, then would you know everything, or as much as it was -- close to everything, because I would get away from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought to the lady in the emergency service of the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to go to a cardiologist -- I was going to be going to be going to that patient.
And to report the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which gives me a heart heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, they fill out of blood, and that's why there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read about it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on her heart.
I gave him some water pills to be able to remove liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes there.
He sent her house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, I was going to call my head and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that makes a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to her house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior that said, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so assured that until I asked the nurse that I would join the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, <unk> "Yes, I think I'm fine."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance and the ambulance and the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, of it.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I was trying to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I didn't do normally, actually.
I went through the emergency emergency service.
And there was another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lady <unk> before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most physicians of emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
So the three words are you remember that?
He remembers the patient he sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and to the edge of death.
By an hour of having come to her house, after I gave him the high -- suffered a collapse and her family called the <unk> the ambulance and the <unk> the <unk> with a <unk> blood pressure -- which means a shock of severe.
I barely breathe and was blue.
<unk> personnel -- all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care therapy and waiting for all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that he never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they let him go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks later, I got rid of it and I experienced for the first time the shame <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt himself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad about it.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I would get things out and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on a <unk> day, it opened the sky and finally came out, and I was wondering if I'd feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I had the efforts to be perfect for me to do not make more errors, I would avoid those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, it was time for the emergency department in a community hospital north in Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient in the <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but it can be <unk> and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He fortunately, she didn't.
You get <unk> antibiotics via <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to me, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again and again.
Two times on the same turn of the emergency turn, they don't <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought it had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it was normal.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I was doing it.
I checked it up, and you see some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon surgeon.
Both were operated and recovered as well.
But every case I <unk> I <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> ashamed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone to talk about failure, after failure? after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg is that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which are making mistakes and those who are making mistakes that they can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> the ones that have <unk> results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as a antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you try to bring medicine to the people who make mistakes, we're going to get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and citizen journalism, I've done a bad personal study and medical errors to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to the Toronto Star wrote to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black Black Black Black <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, in which one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where chronic infections are increasingly more and more <unk> to cause chaos and death.
In this country, they were <unk> <unk> <unk> medical errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain coming up with <unk> eyes and <unk> to alcohol and, suddenly, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always like the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we remove all the professionals likely to be wrong, well, you will not have anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, it's a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the chief <unk> to the chief of surgery -- this is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And their students were <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> you can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> is human, you know, they accept it, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving and a loving and support and support for everybody <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human <unk>
And I feel a lot about it, but I'm trying to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk> day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently made a survey of over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half American American, are about 70 per day.
Not a long ago, in a research followed by a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks that are driven by these executives and the time that we are trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How do you study the way that they're driving those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to the <unk> of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> supermarket.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asked by one occasion, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed to the buses full of tourists all the day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
They put a <unk> to <unk> right to the grocery store.
We put it out of six <unk> or out of 24 different flavors and looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there were <unk> a 60 percent, that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what was more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
And they stopped when he had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought the 30 percent.
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six, that if they were at 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably have to be able to be <unk> -- less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices are really sensitive to <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the topic of the day, the financial <unk>
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in looking at whether the number of hedge funds were available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of money funds had less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 <unk> the rate of participation came to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, more people will be able to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts for the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to, to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative implications by giving them more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they <unk> the decision, that <unk> even when this is against the self-interest of interest.
You are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they clearly get better.
The main reason is that we are able to look at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choosing that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their businesses.
The first one is <unk>
You've heard earlier, but it's never been more than today, than this is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of getting rid of creative options, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> cost, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less likely to have increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> and more <unk>
You know that in average, in average, they have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there are about 100,000 products.
But the world's largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato made.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged from how to drive better choices is the <unk> <unk> the Harvard program.
Harvard Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe fund of life.
What they really want to do is they want to choose them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday audience with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. So whatever is ready to accept the deal.
They're not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
And actually, you had more information on the first hand, that in the second hand, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of <unk> which is <unk>
So people understand differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive for people to get more positive people.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting in which they were going to have a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, they were looking at exactly how we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we gave the staff to you think of the positive things that we would think about in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> accounts <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in the <unk> supermarkets throughout the corridor of the <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two views of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating rating is totally useless.
The categories have to tell you something to <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge fundraising.
I know who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision -- you buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows you completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these vary in the number of choices that offers each of you.
<unk> color outside of the car.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, at a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what do I go to <unk>
How about you are.
If you get <unk> always the default button in each decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> the default button over and again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they go there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the picking the box of changes does not say anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways they made us choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> -- complexity complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices will be able to practice your choices.
Thank you very much.
In the years, in the East Germany in East Germany -- if you had a typewriter it had to be <unk> to the government.
So I had to register a text leaf of example written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a piece of the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive of someone who could do this, so much that this will make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and it takes one page, that page is going to end up with a few yellow dots on every page that are still a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be able to do a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phones is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The secret secret service -- two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most organized crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate them to motivate the opinions, they motivate them to motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> like Anonymous who do to protest and the last group is the United States, the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the collapse last fall because of a <unk>
I read the safety of the site and performed a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with <unk> government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> the death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign foreign authority.
And they gave the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the protesters <unk> the secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the building, they found a lot of papers.
Those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based on Germany that had been based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government for <unk> the communication of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool.
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide a tool for the governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it goes further.
You get the connection to the Internet.
They would have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
Now, if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to live today, it will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a management we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park Park doesn't have fences in the top of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, such as the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> so much to lions.
They were dying are warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they are also annoying with the problem.
So kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping male lions see the pen from far.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that he was close to the <unk>
But male lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were left, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing isn't moving, it's always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how you see it lions when they come from night.
And the lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to exploit other predators like I.M. <unk> and it's also being used to <unk> elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and <unk>
Even I took my friends to my community, and we set up lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid on the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes fly and told me that one day would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions in the head.
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electrical power. A close <unk>
<unk> I know that we were already invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it once, and one time, <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: On the canyon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to be <unk> in every step that I had a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would have all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until all of a sudden it changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution first.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never gone hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> you know, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a short time, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child in her arms in her arms looking at his face of her mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine would spread from North Korea to <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and cortex and cortex.
They were also made more and more <unk> the energy, all around me was completely dark on the night except by the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a blue picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then my abilities in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to go off.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another one, "This was a <unk> <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America seek asylum in <unk> <unk>
But many of you can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were eventually released from a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape, so many other North America haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can be <unk> at a second.
That's why 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to put my identity, and I decided to put it to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what I was expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because 67 years of <unk>
Even through a crisis crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I started <unk> to my new life, I got an alarming rate.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent my family, and, as it punishment my family was going to be displaced to the force to a distant location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a police officer.
And he asked all of you and started asking them questions.
Like my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but I usually believed me.
We made all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards.
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I made everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to short of the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man wondering, "What's the problem?"
I was so shocked that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North America and get them to <unk>
I was interviewing it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why would I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown, a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when they were more <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community support are actually the rays of hope that the people are needed.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of the English language, practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are still in contact with family members inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've been a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help by giving North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the South Center name to represent something else, so they changed to the South Los Angeles as if this is what this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles -- <unk> of <unk> fast food <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home from the food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to get more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart diseases in Los Center in Los Center in Africa.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I was pleased to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house you see the effects of the current food system that have in your <unk>
I see chairs of wheels <unk> and sold as a <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of how to drive 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land strip that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet for three.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it right.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come to me in Iceland because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to do it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our forest of food, trees, trees, <unk> you know, the nine vegetables all over.
What we do, we are kind of a group of paid for gardeners of all the <unk> all of the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came to me on top of it, and I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, -- the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
An order for planting food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go <unk>
Because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the American city with more <unk>
It's 68 miles of <unk> land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million plants of <unk>
Why on Earth don't look like this?
<unk> a plant -- 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars to the result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up in there, <unk> my children there.
I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I love my art.
Just like an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They were <unk> to see what the land can be done. If you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my kindergarten became a tool of education, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one time, who came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, I went out and see very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was going to see people who were so close to hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't really temes that people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I don't have a fear that you go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time when I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people coming from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you're growing <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if nothing about this is going to be <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they are, I see color kids that are on this way designed for them, that doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and convert them into <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's funny about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work people out of the street, to get the kids on the street, who know the <unk> the pride and the honor to grow their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to do sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You know, you take them to pick up your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some crap to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road with me.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains, a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we will <unk>
And especially if you're going on on your bike and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands -- very close to the cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution to that is to make roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands -- has pores and water can pass through it, so all water is flow up to the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and you have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't have no water <unk>
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Watch that on this road the stones on the surface of the surface are over.
First, a stone, then then many more and more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how the damage is in this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the <unk> light -- this <unk> this <unk> -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they will be separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> <unk> of steel, from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small bits, and we can mix those little bits out with the <unk>
Then we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, as you see here, you use to make a machine <unk>
<unk> can flow -- especially steel is very good at it.
So what you need to do is you have to heat steel and melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
<unk> oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a bit of road -- 400 feet of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a <unk> test to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road is going to last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took many samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made aging at samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our machine <unk> and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using fiber of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool first before I can show you how the cancer acts works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the <unk> sound in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban was <unk> she yelled at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban ran out of Afghanistan and they were illegal to be in school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be able to be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we were taking a different route so that nobody could suspect where they were <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bags so that it looks like we were shopping for.
The school was in a house over 100 of us moving into a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother was to school and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother was a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and he was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can actually steal your money out of your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your own education, we will do.
So, you still want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged in my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I am the first woman, I wear it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> for them, despite the face of it, even though it even comes to a comparative opposition of them.
As a <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
So less than a month, he and his daughter went off from <unk> to his village, and literally, <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to her house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not to hurt the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school count on <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And we found that these changes don't last a lot, after the retreat of American troops
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who are <unk> for them, that the <unk> see a future <unk> and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary style of <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the amount of <unk> mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with a lot of other citizens sitting inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were on the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some loss of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure -- the culture and the moral structure of the society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved one, and so many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> a <unk> and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation,
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about developing capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> of the <unk> a movement of women, leaders of orientation and <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and for our right of engaging participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first election for 52 years.
However, very recently, the joy of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another day with the murder of the murder of the U.S. Ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights rapes from prisoners and their lack of rule of law.
Our society, made up for a revolutionary mindset -- and it gets away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I am here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose <unk> we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't do it.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by political policies of domination and <unk> both of men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the choices needed the choices that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the ultimate representation of the women that will need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as dangerous agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as practical agents and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also putting the mercy instead of <unk> the collaboration in the competition, the <unk> instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to get the end of the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God's <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known in all the <unk> traditions of the same root in Arabic than the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> and that it involves all the humanity that men and the women, that all the tribes and all villages have <unk>
And so, like the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all the existence.
This is what it tells us, "My mercy is all about stuff."
This is how it tells us to us, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That you all get away with the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a hacker question, which has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all do the usual <unk> Why should it be left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, I thought my soul was <unk> I was going to get my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a nonprofit, <unk> of love, where every year -- and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the <unk> list, <unk> between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years old, with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all the races, all of all, every income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> relationships, <unk> and long duration or said otherwise, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> the reason that domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who liked it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women in between 16 and 24 years has three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> university and he was working on a very important bank bank.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
He had a few big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and he seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the delusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of the <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me: which was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who put passion to help girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why that <unk> in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices because of your partner, so I had my work left my work and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical, financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to be so safe -- I had to get three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in your pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause the trauma that she lived from smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and although I had never lifted me my hand, my life was already at danger, every single day.
The first physical attack came up with five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises had disappeared, I put my mother suit, and I married him with him.
Despite what happened, he was confident that we lived happy forever, because I loved her and he also wanted me a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of a family to be with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never make it hurt.
I spent two times more of our honey.
And the first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head that I would have a lot of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he would spread through traffic and threw a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So I actually had a good company.
So going back to my question: Why would I get <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that he could help <unk> facing his <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just be <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that makes people, because we, the victims, we know something that you do -- it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of education in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim had end up to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by the judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still continue to ask why it's just not going?
I was able to go out, because of one last <unk> I was going to beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all of the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family friends, all the way out of it, and I'm here today because all of you would be <unk>
We have the tendency to lead to victims of victims like <unk> <unk> women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
So for some people is a way to say "The fault is yours for <unk> as if the victims of the victims intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who have also assumed that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to us and to embrace their lives joyful lives and happy as a <unk> wives are completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I became marrying a cute little man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to get more to have ever more, is a gun <unk> pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
At this moment, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> how stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> will only be silent.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They slept the <unk> to the light talking about it with their kids, their fellow <unk> their friends and family.
<unk> their view of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the English signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims of safe <unk>
Together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. My name's Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed up like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift from clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
So these wishes are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to be this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so you don't do anything as I get on my head.
All right.
Why did I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but they also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I would take the back and get the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I made two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did model is because I won the genetic lottery and I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> also we've been associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> on the fashion that <unk> Hold on. They are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we would get them to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York University told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> that was less than four percent, were not white ...
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I didn't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this <unk> list, it's still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I tell them, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of <unk> American magazine or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a copy and a pair of jobs to your backs, no matter what you want, if you want to be president that you want to be president of the United States, but your credit card <unk> for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that <unk> and also the first time he used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
So I was showing up with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the photos were French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those pictures.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: "Is it for free?
I have too many a two-inch heel.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went to a shop and I forgot to take the money, and they gave me a free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> you jumped a red light and of course, and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
We were able to get these privileges by my looking, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who stood up with them and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
By researching for this talk, I found out that in 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure rises to by 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is, if you're a little bit thinner and you've got the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe I was doing it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people and creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is, I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the younger hair and the youngest hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs and the <unk> <unk> and the clothes are more on the way, but probably the women physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion for me to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 favorite pictures -- and I wasn't my <unk>
There was no <unk> directors, no <unk> no chance to repeat the photos, and not even a minimum care of lighting.
In fact, most of them took them out of tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and the 5.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started asking for the tourists that they were going to take us to get the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and fortunately, never no one has <unk> the camera.
So we were not aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This is a picture of a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what happened that day in a way that was five years old, I could understand.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They are also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in every way.
Because although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how they perceived and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope to illusion is a whole year.
Recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it got a dry in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the pirate store that <unk> small in previous visits of the previous ones.
And it described to me what was five years old at that same place.
He <unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York City are universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always a picture.
I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you didn't get to get to someone and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the more <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species. These are 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are those <unk> are important, first of all, provide vital ecological services <unk>
They are our <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria help to absorb the anthrax that they would not be <unk> and caused huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of <unk>
<unk> also have enormous historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the <unk> symbol and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they're doing very important <unk> to open sky. In places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are on extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and have taken a <unk>
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs, you have a huge <unk> time <unk> -- the number of cases of anger has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> go up the top of the <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines does this to the birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Okay, so we're doing these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a living problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without <unk> without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything that we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia into this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river River, and we teach local <unk> and we teach local tomatoes and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't go to work --  -- we were just amazed that the local <unk> were so much as the local <unk> had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a wouldn't grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to <unk> "Look at the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought that only of Italians would make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the American did, what they were doing, what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
All Western beings are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I treat all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little bit of <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference was put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided for the 27 years to be able to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you never need anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> the <unk> of the local people who have the dream to become a better person.
So what do you?
It would never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We meet in a coffee. We meet in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of reaching a community to tell people what to do, why not, for one time, they were <unk> but not in <unk> meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this blind thing.
The smartest people in their community, you are not even familiar with it, because they don't address their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor in the business -- which is established with you in your house, at the kitchen table at the kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this junk junk where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me looking at the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I got <unk> and <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before you're involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company <unk>
The planning is the kiss of the death of the business of business.
So now we <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to conversation with you.
You have to give you an <unk> privacy, has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What is you going to show you this tomorrow?
<unk> local people -- that's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- fossil revolution -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they met this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the dung produced by six million horses and the dung produced by six million horses and <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would have in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed <unk> manufacturing companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few too few factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
In other ways, they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things: <unk> the product you want to sell it has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic paper, and you have to have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 companies icons in the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, is only one: No one was started by one person.
The word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who are coming from a little business of small business <unk> on bars in bars -- with their dedicated individuals who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who did for this <unk> someone who will ask you, what will you need?
What can you? Can you do that?
Okay, you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You need to look at <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The ones around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild wild that are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
That always gives the music.  There's a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most <unk> of American <unk>
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn in a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
She was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
It gave it clarity to the significant things in my current life.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be catching up the day to day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house on a giant board, and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> --  Before I die to die I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
She stopped dying I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live out of the <unk>
She stopped dying I want to show you one more."
Before I died, I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, <unk> me and gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways -- it's about giving the reflection and the <unk> and remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the center of civic center, we made a kit and now they have been done walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
Together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions in the increase, it's more important than ever before, to find ways of preserving the perspective, and remember that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that would be more power.
And thinking about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces, shared spaces better than we care about individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people that surrounds us cannot only help improve places, can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
It doesn't speak, but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares it <unk> what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and watch me on this: never <unk>
When I sing from our childhood, I'm trying to tell you words that I could not even be able to <unk> it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you will be pee on my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk> birthday birthday.
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- although I don't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing -- that was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual stands in a different form of a different form of there, that's so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development development in the world, there is no cause no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new person in my life.
When a few months spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that there was <unk>
As I grew up, it would come back more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature of a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different than it doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could imagine, one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is in the moment where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been to be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communication to give me a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was afraid.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great words and unknown words.
But when you develop those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had those conversations with the students. They surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to environment, and health care and health care -- and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers were not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
They won't tell us that they just study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the power structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't they say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing to make them <unk>
In contrast, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies. They are ways of turning it and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you asked about why they call <unk>  What do I do? bullets are killing them, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the Tower of <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then then provide graphs that will lead to our other senses and create a more profound sense of understanding what they were <unk>
I think these are just some key that you can help the other open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge no matter or platform or <unk> and that, when he wins it for the mere use of monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means to <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words the exact words they were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London who won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's a literal one.
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and policy interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And they weren't even <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed act.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King if he did it or his compiling ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title that they came together.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious degree with a <unk> <unk> <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I was able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is kind of going to follow out there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one extent is <unk> --  <unk> you might be able to stay for <unk> years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to tell you is that the title of President of the United States is not at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to disposal, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of flying vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So eventually I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was an uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to be feeling humble when you tell you what the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually it changes a lot more the words than the words might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is filled with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive tools.
Like each other, I have a cheap flashlight of light -- they would support the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole in the ground.
And I was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met the control and dropped <unk> feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep end of that hole to risk their lives without any pay and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're prey in slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met in a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to be a degree grade.
When we finished talking to me very sad, I was very sad, to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me kind of <unk> your stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these sites.
A few of them even, as my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there's now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during all of the <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary for a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> of <unk>
However, today, you can enslave entire families by generations of <unk> dollars of 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves they have value, but those who produce them.
The slavery exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This was a strange and striking show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C, men, men, women, in fact, children, in fact, <unk> entire families in a heavy <unk> <unk> stack of <unk> stack bricks in their heads, up to 18 at the time, and they take the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16  17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it <unk> was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment much better than these people.
Back in the blast I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side very quickly, he grabbed me and said, <unk> you don't do it. Don't you do it.
And it explained to me very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation, that they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for their liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks for miles through <unk> <unk> until the <unk>
Those big <unk> were more heavy than children who had charge and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> and made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, they cut their <unk> their <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be hard for me to work on this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It took me over some stairs <unk> that gave this dirty <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you meet in the craft, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- they have small rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven -- they are forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that minute, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs for where they were <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no big enough enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual trafficking.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are being sold every year as a sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families embedded in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still could be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a look at a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers -- some younger people, some younger children, makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work <unk> long in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up was <unk> the subject of her canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to release the branches.
A lot of it was <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to run away, and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> treating the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one in the way.
<unk> <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will get to be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners of <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
He asked us to do it by a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path barely and said, "This is the track, this is the way.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos about my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children bound to their back and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well, they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be shipped to another area in which they would get the stone to be able to extract the gold.
First of sight, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look more close to the margin and we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be able to end up like this <unk> victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
And when he died, his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle will be slave in the mines.
When I met her, I had worked in <unk> and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's been forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he has been liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of the face to a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen in the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll give witness to them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not about magazines. They're about people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I'm going to happen to me not to think about these many beautiful, <unk> people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these pictures wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematics applied and there's a particular problem for whom <unk> are like management stations.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a certain initial opinion that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, they destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> which, in their time was a virtuous ballet dancer in ballet <unk>
In the last few years, it has been very progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress of an objective way and ultimately, the only way we know if there is a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's disease and other disorders of the movement there are no <unk> and so the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do <unk>
They don't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that what I want to do is as a conventional way for a chance, you see, in some sense at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds at all. We can imagine as dancers of a ballet ballet ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sound and we all have the genes needed <unk> for example.
And as the ballet one, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a kid learning to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as we <unk> and as the Parkinson's disease is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the depths of the bottom you can see an example of clean <unk> of string strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the exams based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They are at the minimum cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears at a mass scale.
These are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulty of patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do <unk> massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we will give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price and get recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: And Tom Rielly: So I want to get all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> you may not <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have an precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> Much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic work and now has been shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well, what we <unk> the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're smart <unk>
We were <unk> in the dark, in <unk> rooms and large, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin of still more perfect, we can make it possible and <unk> them in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste for the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where he was <unk> and <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little village of fishermen located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The standard water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles away inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of fish -- dead fish <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and cameras and cards and cards.
They all did the same thing.
They were able to take them to different places of villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the town.
It helped to clean up public bathrooms -- massive <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't going to go over myself, my horizons that something happened.
When the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help think about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl, I had to get it very accurately and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time, they got a little bit more photos and they got more <unk> so I walked back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks, I had 150 people to be <unk> from <unk>
In Japan, in July, <unk> <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once on the week we use our scanner into the temporary TV libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. It could be a few weeks old.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw up with pretty much hand as a guide areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos of the water <unk> in saltwater water, covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even with <unk> all of it next to the time of time continue <unk> so I was able to be a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless he was clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> guide <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As an <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had started to <unk> her himself and stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been, we were able to <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures shared something about her story with us.
A few colleagues on her husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble quite far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find his whole family and know everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos his son younger son read about 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could afford to do something that he could be able to look at, something that he could remember from the past day that would not have been marked on the last day from March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there, hundreds of them were helped us to clean hand over <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- the great majority of the hands came to their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than a thousand into teams and materials, most of the ink in the ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would get to us, but the first thing that we would look for.
What about this was about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is give someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger to bring up something, using their talent for something that is not being perfect models of perfect skin.
To finish myself I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent it the day I came back from Japan after six months.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from Grandma to the small girl, gathering around a baby, I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family, my mother, my mother, and my daughter just <unk> hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few basic needs -- right?
Thank you. 
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a thousand million, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create in the slow camera of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can be able to see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray and <unk>
So if I take a laser pointer and turn it into a second <unk> or it goes into a second <unk> to create a photons pack of just a wide millimeter square.
And that package of photons, that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a regular bullet does.
So if you take that bullet and this <unk> pack and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons disperse into this <unk>
What is the kind of light in <unk> <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on motion.
So Coca-Cola is not <unk>  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons pack that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
And part of the light <unk> goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
A lot of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the insights of the top of the bottle, after several boxes, the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet bullet and make it the same distance and we see it at slow to about 10 billion times, how many people think it would take us to look at that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a bullet slow movement.
And what about trying with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato tomato and the vertical wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I was thinking about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is <unk> in your inner and it comes back to a number of <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in prison?
As photographers, you know, if we took a photo in the <unk> it goes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I'll barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that set of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, though.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. I want to go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a little fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works like this fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good resolution resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point it corresponds to the distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture of <unk> that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we look at <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's at the turn of the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> we could be able to see the inside of the body without <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems in health care of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, and I became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be a scientific visualizations but we can be able to be able to be able to get scientific visualizations but we can be able to be able to be able to get scientific visualizations but we
To create a new form of computer photography with slow and dark code.
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you get away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects of the light, and I would have delighted to see this image.
The order that happens in the world is sometimes invested in the camera on the world.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and put it to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of change.
This is fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
They have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot, almost all of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, about my phone, and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission on the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single city provider in Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sent an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years old, in your phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet provider or the Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, and they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10 thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> Vietnam.
<unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that in that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please make me <unk> all the information I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask it, and I didn't get a concrete answer, it was all blah, blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a bank lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, "We don't give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> a deal.
They will get the demand and they would send me the information that I would have.
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 30 lines of information.
I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I look at the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization in my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go from <unk> train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other what time they call each other to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who sent an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, not all of the <unk> of <unk>
Because the state agencies today want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to use it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to join your friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not done in fashion.
When you go home, you go home to your representative that only because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain palsy, and that's why it takes all the time.

It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus -- my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, brothers, although they are.
It only happens by accidents, as the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not an inspiration. And I don't want any of us in the room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they have a disabled person.
Let's walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, drive in circles for parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled people.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and I say, C is just one of them.
There would be a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same principle.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in your "No sake.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three largest sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three hundred sisters were going to public school, my parents <unk> to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all the top note -- we all had the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five years putting my <unk> in her feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I was doing it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very hard and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten kindergarten was walking as a speaker, which has received a lot of <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still in the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating a <unk> so <unk> the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> I'm crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to graduate school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to wear <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer summer on the coast of Jersey, I was not.
I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we're not going to go to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On summer vacation. I often was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk -- so I was drinking milk and warm on the back, <unk> me in the Sea <unk> and I remember the water would be <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the cure <unk> was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before we do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can do it in my head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a grant for the <unk> University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the white <unk> of the theater.
And all of me <unk>
I made all the tasks of least smart, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow on Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "When I started screaming at the four <unk>
I've got <unk> <unk>
Finally, they were finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I was finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the CEO of the theater department, crying in historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, and he told me why and she told me that because they could not do the stunts of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the chairs of risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role to which he was literally born and they gave him an actress without cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I came back home, and my first tour <unk> was extra as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that police directors don't <unk> actors, <unk> <unk>
They just appealed to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, he took comic comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he dropped on the top of the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had a brain <unk>
I worked in clubs. All the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little disgusting rumor that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and time to remind the game directors, and <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier to fight to the challenge of the stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program for cable <unk> with Keith <unk>
I went out as if it was to a graduate dance dance to me to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I stood up at the desk of the <unk> not to go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew I would not come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was going to be like <unk> full-time and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
They say that children are <unk> but they would never get away from me or a little girl or a little bit larger.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"Is it <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A reviewer suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> can't do someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they didn't survive, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> fewer hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need a whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world. <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started <unk> <unk> a charity to give the refugee refugee kids a little bit of what my parents were <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me doing live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young town.
I don't know their name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without all, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he told him about a gentleman who offers him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
She meets a <unk> group of people, who gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They present to a young man.
Finally goes home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That kid from that little village with the New York dreams was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a connected organization to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little village of a little village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends up with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing I arrived.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the great promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to the door of terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of academic cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a business conference.
<unk> about 90 Jewish leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a graduate college college college -- frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations for being <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get about point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time expanding to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit -- and I think that entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of the business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business progress.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was it the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, he would survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for family, and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, the young families, they can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink pink ones.
By the way, he doesn't wear pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for a NGO, to work for the government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a cultural spirit culture, it's really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their real ideas.
They need experience and orientation to <unk> in development and put out of their businesses.
They are going to get the young people with the resources that they need to prescribe the support they need to move from conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, spirit spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park -- this is how it's called, when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids on the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
They gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> Mountains in the north of the New York City state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we were able to pretend that we were the first human beings at step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with heart disease, balls of aluminum <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they had to, who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and they were getting a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash into <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products -- every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like the uniform to take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through their routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel on the trucks.
And operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as mainstream as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very quickly.
It costs a lot of used to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still holding weight to the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most <unk> <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and stare at you.
They just want to get <unk> so the driver is not paying attention to.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is as a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always supposed to be moving.
And also the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I think that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first license for public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and its dangers inherent in them in very real ways.
People that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have a space for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger of the <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just set your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average rate that we need.
I mean by just the speed as they used to move in the little contemporary time.
We are usually not <unk> and we had to clean up with us our coffee cup -- our stock <unk> our water <unk>
We use them -- the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that it would take from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help you reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they are.
And their work allows us to do ours.
They are almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always because of one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste on the street, grabbed my son, <unk> and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey out of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's go right.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have to account for all the cost, even the very real human cost very <unk>
The city waste, what we think of when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and in their lives, the next few you see someone whose work is to clean the garbage out of you, you would have a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects as a example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are a lot of in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> it generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a hot climate that's going from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, what is nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a worth being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really guided with the ancient market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site is located in a very much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist yet.
And in addition to two other streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs in the building.
And this spreads with <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that would spread through its own shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes in every floor because of the space form.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also of light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors using the inner light of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it was not what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in the end of accounts were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was more economic not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting in the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting areas and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water from the inner <unk>
It waits for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big, big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
And during that analysis, I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access to free lines connected by <unk>
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets to existing streets, by creating 12 basic blocks similar similar to the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changes the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell cell, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So they <unk> a scheme that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to them.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density at the upper levels and a lower density in the plant ...
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as close to the community that is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and get them up and do activities like running a two kilometers in the morning, or to jump from a building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment has to connect the nature of the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a lot of very bright hair and a little bit of a little <unk> of cute. I was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I was in the classroom, I went in the classroom, I took my teacher grades.
And then I did.
And I had the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few these.
All the same.  And I set up to put the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> you get the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the <unk> and I put them up a row out of it, just because of being there, because I had a <unk>
I'm still struck by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all the obvious <unk>
I will never be <unk>
But most of all, I was amazed at the reason why I was bothered by this little little girl, so good for <unk>
I ignored the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of South America in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would take care or long duration or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which they study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if you wouldn't have English, there would be literature.
I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> and <unk> and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost that has all of them.
This year is spent 100 years of his work -- "In the <unk> of time to <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as mothers who get reduced to the person, to their wish, are a very good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel generally we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being in place, and the audience, we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the <unk> right?
<unk> do all novelists like <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every neat charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds up to his collection of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an absolute emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> is <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of brilliant hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
This is why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> <unk> the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his non-zero-sum agony of sudden listening to behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of your lover -- then they defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for truth -- a real truth, in fact, what to <unk> -- the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us to suffer, it causes us to have a range of feelings and much more profound and vital than a wise man who can give us <unk>
It's telling us that we go to search for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there's some other excitement that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other emotion that we will give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other excitement that teaches us to look at the intensity of such <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a very <unk> young man who was consumed with the idea that his woman would get it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get away in what his wife's doing.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion with no cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are going to look at intensity, but no precision.
In fact, the more <unk> we are, we are more likely to become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> are helping us behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years old, I'm going to think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A woman in Michigan of 52 years was captured by having created a false on Facebook from which they were sent to <unk> <unk> itself, for a year.
For one year. Every year.
She was trying to go to the new girlfriend of his former former boyfriend, I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge -- even though we say, creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to make our minds, and once we are on the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> at a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to get to the <unk> of your self and <unk> what ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your <unk> <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in a time of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> which needs to <unk> <unk> it needs the <unk> genius -- but it looks it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each one of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you get <unk> <unk> all with their solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We are not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells you there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> was in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> can be <unk> that idea of being the <unk>
It might still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember we have fiction to <unk>
There are only fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July <unk> Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of the Apollo <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence on the gray surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest of peace in American history.
To reach the Moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo took a job to about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including crew crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on the surface of which Aldrin went after death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So, why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why is it <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the same words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some wonder, why do you <unk>
Why would it turn in our goal?
And you might ask, why scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> The <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the precious of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and all of the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a sailing boat -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles an hour.
From 1970, no human is going back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew crew crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism joyful thing about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see the problems that we imagine that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy -- curing cancer, or to feed the world population seem to be able to be able to <unk>
I remember watching the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> tube from the rocket <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that doesn't happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> and they were enriched with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed the selling <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for the Silicon Valley, which is that they have created fewer ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years that they were <unk> heroin Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused it to <unk> the creation of ideas that are driven by the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment alone, that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital, and that development is in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound ones.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy as solar as solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in a price <unk>
Now, scientists, businesspeople and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of a finite energy -- <unk> a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there's no hope in the political climate that we'll see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed like technological, turns out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure in the delivery of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can make things better like the harvest or systems for the storage and food system -- but there will be functional as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon showed the war to the cancer in 1971, but we found that there are many types of cancer, some extremely resistant many types of cancer, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must be able to support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, does it do with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like on the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who would be <unk> and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction as the way to explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
OK, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline in trust, is a very general belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should have the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> one goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First <unk> why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might be augmented in others.
I don't have any of it.
But I can turn it to opinion polls and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still be pretty <unk> the characters are quite <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is the evidence that enough?
What records of opinion are of course views.
What else can you get?
What they look at are the <unk> attitudes that the people are making certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the teachers of <unk>
I would probably be able to ask: "What do you make what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in some other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to build the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official or official or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary school I know to give the class class but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they are trying to make good judgment to the fact of trust in something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
This is not that the goal that I <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not in what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were taking their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, I think of them, I think, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, he says, yeah, okay, OK, that means that what matters is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to make a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible that we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but I don't want to get a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they will be able to get their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is we are going to be <unk> before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and <unk> and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once he was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative <unk> that I attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we find that the system accountability that is meant to ensure the <unk> and <unk> tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've probably all heard of similar examples.
It takes all of that, for the target.
I think the goal is that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you will be worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> the people that are safe and whether to try to determine whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. This is the trial, simple action, the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should have to rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if you're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, it's signature because they give us some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it for all people, all the time.
But you also have to add <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
So how do you do it?
That makes it every day, everywhere, makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very well.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where my socks buy my socks -- he says that I can be <unk> without giving explanations.
They take me and get it back the money, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, can determine when and how other person is worth trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes deeper into the digital space, so that when the strong hole against the screen is its physical body to the Pacific.
<unk> can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science <unk> of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
<unk> a transparent bombsight with camera cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, reaching inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a place in real space, <unk> is as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or point to the words with the virtual touch sensor that there's the bottom of the floating screen.
<unk> can spread or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and we make digital information coming to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and thinking about things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system involves the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea more far, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so that we can make them physical and <unk>
What would this future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical dream.
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of quantum levitation and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and the famous <unk> by Michael Jordan, you can play it as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's most fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just showing us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without us to have to get them out of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you will, that barrier, the only limit that stays our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to lead to a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only one path right to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer of Chinese.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But no adult will get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All my friends were <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much higher to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to be <unk> OK.
We went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the U.S. in 1995, and what were the first books that would be here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about <unk> Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this trap.
And I find it with a new culture that was also led to my reading <unk>
So let's put a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map I thought it was out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why do we not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of getting lost in translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be able to feel like <unk> never.
Having a <unk> <unk> really is nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, where the dreams come from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a PhD student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> came up on the couch couch and I took off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it was easy to just move my head while they would take the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying Alex, and so I looked at her, she was right.
You start working on, and you start working on, she has children later, until dying later.
For the same as Alex and I had time to work.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> <unk> me to press Alex to talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe they slept with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit on head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And then I realized that this kind of wildlife separates was a real problem and had real consequences of real consequences, not only for Alex and their loving life, but for careers, families and the future of all over the place.
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody gets to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream a <unk> I want to see. It's good. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and experiences that give you a way to your life to have been past for 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future <unk> at 30 years.
So we know that the brain ends up its second and last phase of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now that's the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to the top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about development, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the dragonflies are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the line of <unk>
Researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
The journalists <unk> the <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think that happens when you give him a <unk> in your head, and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the meaning and his ambition and his ambition and there's absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> really cool as you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship is not -- I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything will be fine."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better notice the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing in stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the guys here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the old ones, and so many of you start a career, choosing a city, choosing a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are a research that begin to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful and stressful and stressful <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give him a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing?" What was you thinking?"
I want to change what people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having a crisis crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or the entertainment, but you couldn't still decide, so that I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult, their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she was getting up in our <unk> -- "You don't pick your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day she'd got his head on his legs and I cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of job to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his chance.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade of Emma was going on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of us would have a man or woman deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis, and <unk> capital capital.
For your identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital creates a capital of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that should not tell -- that by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that it would make jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I said to Emma than urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the people who come together with friends with a similar minds are limited to who you know how you know, how you talk about, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will come out almost always comes out of their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the dogs have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half is not, and the weak links are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information goes on.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose their family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon go back to her family, when she has a partner and we form his own family.
I said to Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better to sit on head than 20 or even the 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or tell you now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you did, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead to do instead of just doing it or killing time with anyone who is that they would take them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a quarter of a cousin who was working in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That business supply gave him a reason to quit boyfriend, with the living one.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special <unk> in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I was sending me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are as airplanes coming out of the airport, from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light on your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the people that have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your <unk> get a capital of identity, use their weak <unk> choose your family.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach mathematics to graduate students, in New York City schools.
And like any teacher, I took tests and tests.
And I just gave them tasks.
When the work went on, I would have grades.
What struck me that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance test <unk> <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, secure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time.
After many years of <unk> I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy of <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children would be far away from the competition.
We studied teachers who are working in slums. I'm really difficult to <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the more effective at improving the results of the learning of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, and wondering what of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my job questionnaires and then waited about more than a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher chance of <unk> even when <unk> in every single feature I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National National <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a good job ethic of work?
How do we keep using the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going to go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, which is commonly associated with it or even related backwards to the prayers of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they fail, because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all back with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
It was <unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was overwhelmed by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall Wall
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language.
I started thinking about how a new new method of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence of the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic knowledge.
The first 200 will allow the first to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today we start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you might be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was crying in a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it's in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call radical about these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is company, three are <unk>
If a person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> this is this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a prisoner's <unk> in the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- to remember, because a tree speaker is pretty idiot.
Remember fire?
Two <unk> it becomes very hot.
Three drops, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
So when you use this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of hundred characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun along the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and you have a magic wand, and to take a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of the child art show.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a kid who was <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk> <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> <unk> shoes to defeat the military were made by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing about the magician of the magician is that the most creative characters and <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I was able to see Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So they were so happy in the room and I was impressed as a mom and she was impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
He would have the feeling that Luke is one to a military to <unk>
So we had this with the magician of Oz of <unk>
How do he win Dorothy at the movie?
We're doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow <unk> OK? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much a lot of capital that we're going to force them in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really expected the ticket to begin to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is over, I have a <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though them, kids are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to come up in classic in classic after TED, each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and a man and two men who are raising a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has done a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had been with a friend of the movie assessment that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there are more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other.
Their conversations are about something more than the kid than both like it?  All right?  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> is not the proof of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk>
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors, to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we were <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 movies more popular movies, how many of them think they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress, then is fine.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to break this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story of a male hero, is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charging the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly to the parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing radically.
You've heard about how the new economy is changing the role of the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character was from "Star <unk> You know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories on the ones that tell my <unk> Go and struggle and be more stories where his job looks like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I was more like to do was to look for fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that it would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
There are <unk> and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different the infrared is using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern description of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process it using fake color -- suddenly the place looks like <unk> <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes of the landscape by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Roman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle World, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere in this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about roughly <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved through this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and find the equivalent of the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using <unk>
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see here.
When I say <unk> is how you take them on ice, but instead of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, under a thick layer of <unk> we find a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation from several hundreds of years that date from the Roman Empire -- exactly the same time that we think it's <unk>
We also find jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the jewelry, <unk> of the Middle World, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes out of the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a <unk> jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find any <unk> here, but it will lead to the place in a very close future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle World, which was probably written in <unk> four years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to me, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas actually happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that is made.
Now I had a group of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They're competing with a <unk> race and go in direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide with the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying across the place, wheels that go through their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places, <unk> the threshold of the door, of the door, of the door, of the door, <unk>
And they had the lobby, to the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light -- the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> fortune cookie and you can be able to get into the mouth.
They go through a side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making it most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with time dancing and dancing on his center center, singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now you go to the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, I suppose, as the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
We have the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
We had full poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who was able to memorize the greatest <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be kind of like nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best memories.
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have a average memory.
Everyone you participate in this competition they say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques invented two two years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that academic academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> and brilliant one, although a little <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> in a national TV deck in national TV.
That will help the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon, in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, it was a number of treaties on the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of a little over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory wasn't a thing as rare as it might seem like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we also have changed.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed the cognitive <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined memory and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> in the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College from London invited a group from memory to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some form brains or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are more intelligent than <unk>
They gave a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
And there was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the champions of memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a MRI MRI machine, they will embrace their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different from the brain to others.
In effect, they were <unk> or they looked at a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of autonomous <unk> is driven as an armed race where each year comes up with someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors got to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a <unk>
In your desk, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the right order of <unk> digits -- <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> he says this: I say two people who remember the same word -- I tell you, <unk> you have a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what do you do?"
The person who told the name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said to her work is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It's no relationship to you.
All the other memories you dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> hats white.
They have <unk> in their hands.
<unk> when they come home to work.
You probably want some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is about two and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says like this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring to a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up with his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
We will go to everybody.
But it didn't only kill everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of your mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single time.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What we <unk> learned at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone phone numbers or instructions word for the word of our colleagues, we have memory and remarkable spatial memory and remarkable.
If you were to tell you that the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse speaker, brown in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> in images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to first <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that it would have done -- if you'd been invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely <unk> <unk> image to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then you get in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help you remember it.
This is what the <unk> <unk> <unk> their talks -- not word for word, who is going to confuse it but, typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory collection.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event.
But seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting at taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there's amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is better and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
And I was really hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard set of training for the memory competition.
It's a pair of <unk> and some <unk> <unk> with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could be able to put in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be a good deal for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute to be able to memorize <unk> and phone phone numbers, and it ready, but actually this is not the point.
These are just a single <unk> tricks.
Because they rely on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights on how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It will make a kind of profound processing, a kind of complete care species that most of you can't get in there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what you would -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that he had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walk on our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we wouldn't even be able to be able to process <unk>
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person that you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so we would have just <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am a <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they were all over the television so that every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and I all looked at me. And every time I got <unk> and I would go back wrapped up in a towel -- everybody saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
And those feelings, those emotions I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> of areas, but of those synaptic connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
<unk> determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want to think about, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about this by based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums on art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable, stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know that they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> it has this round thing, underwater brick -- that they leave <unk> which is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the other library, that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of the so-called <unk> -- so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to talk to you and we just push out so much, that we get rid of the people.
All of a black -- this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we are dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go on the other side and go back to those symbols <unk>
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, and so we started to experience <unk> we do just swing the way back to go ahead and over and over and over and over again, and we've done it in the last 30 years, and of course it is, over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I was <unk> from the '70s.
architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be a guess.
<unk> small <unk>
It's really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk> and we use a new material.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we become a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we start to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques on a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few shapes that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academic <unk> and public and public public were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased by a half two and ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly we learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the leading mayors in the world.
So everybody thought if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the next number happened with another star <unk>
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few <unk> elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked into the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we all are photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't happen a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more before what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, in the media, it starts to swing more and faster, until they will be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now do symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked at exactly the product, there were no very surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get into the social media, to share it in the social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those <unk> librarians <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the building on the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> they can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell you that there's no single answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and very complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> <unk> which doesn't take something that has never seen before.
<unk> can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one way to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick based on ideas of what it must be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that will produce.
That means that the buildings will become the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve for a sport or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion, which is so <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to come.
Because no longer matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> buildings, more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the more <unk> existing libraries -- the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it like this great, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
They laughed and <unk> and it gives themselves these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I thought to me, "Well, when were you to do this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for married, "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Between what your mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow school people said, "You don't know who you believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal <unk> that receives these answers on one of their most vulnerable life of their life more emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate in this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure on online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures coming from hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the most prominent thing in the life of someone in front of someone in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of the girls now.
<unk> of the size of zero size are going to dominate our <unk>
The technique of <unk> is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sports and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be very skilled individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to devote more time and effort to look at their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capability, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of the 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for our growth as human beings and how to happen to society and to the field of development development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class. <unk> participate in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention for their physical form.
One in five are not going to meet at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of exams, if you don't think you look at good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're thin, <unk> a smaller note of the average of your fellow people who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, America and China, and China.
And then regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be very clear, we are talking about how you see you, not about how you are.
The low self-esteem on their body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet and not healthy that they can bring them to a food mess of food.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think this is all of this for what they make more harmful decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetics, sex relationships to early ages and without protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing to the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
<unk> percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are going to not only have a positive impact -- but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for any willing to provide an education in body self-worth that works.
An education is fundamental -- but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians to <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you see.
We all can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to grow for the whole person to be valuing the <unk> diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
How to make a difference in the real world, let's make it be the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never <unk> to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think of what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who got on your mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
His <unk> <unk>
It could be just the woman who is two feet away, what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he would be able to do it for not a long legs -- <unk> a <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were able to do this and tell us that we would have to say the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are attached to us.
But let's go back to our children, the truth.
They assume that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as we make us feel.
They encourage self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, will become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi, <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense of Defense <unk>
They were initially telling him innocent but being represented by other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb, in the World Trade Center could not be.
Later on, I would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who was an engineer with a loving mother, master school teacher -- the two made everything possible for me to give me a happy childhood, to give me happy.
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
And so I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to want to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are getting so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to train <unk> in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder and explained to me how to point for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot him to the little light of light on the target and to surprise a surprise of all, especially my goal on fire.
My uncle came back to the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, as a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a <unk> <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground tower in the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone was a moment of packing and go to another city.
As it was always me, the new face of the class was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the whites -- but to be the new of the silent class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say, <unk> <unk> for growing <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera, judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I put in the test of my thinking, was during presidential presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt very passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys who we had ever did, friendship, was Jewish age.
I took a number of days out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to me to believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way as I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is from being homosexual but I know what is being done by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with the character with the character.
In many ways, he became my figure on a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how my mother was changing my way to think, and she told me something that conserving in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone who is going to try to bring up to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way -- that even though I was going to join this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones.
By the victims of terrorism victims -- to talk against those <unk> acts like rejection of my father.
With this simplicity I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this moment, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D and it has a sound sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has fruit and <unk> and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as memories.
And there's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience all it <unk>
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie of their own, you and you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't have any sense that you're aware of.
<unk> is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that are getting what we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective itself.
<unk> by nature, is subjective and subjective being.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I would get that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for the science of <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that submitted Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what it would be <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problem.
Without offend the <unk>
There are actually no problem with consciousness.
Well, it's not about the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how the <unk> work works, how the <unk> how the <unk> are adapting and <unk> and the living organisms are all questions about how to work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we <unk> how we treat <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problem.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> a <unk>
So I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful explanations. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas -- I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy things before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there's no such difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and this is study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as a building building, the space and the mass.
They have fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of nothing more basic.
On the contrary, they are considered fundamental and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time mass, and <unk> laws of Newton.
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't be able to explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas in space -- time, mass, charge, then charge, then for matter of logic, there are I <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts space, the space, the time, the physical processes.
What physicists sometimes say we want to do is we want the fundamental core laws that we can do in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what they do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everybody, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans -- dogs, mice -- even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think like, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But thinking about thinking is that the photons can have a certain amount of raw feeling -- you know, some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws that will be thinking about thinking with physical process -- is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there is awareness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, very complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> neuroscientist, took this type of theory and developed it with evolutionary methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration -- which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And I am supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, as well as significant as significant awareness of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there is still a level of consciousness of a different consciousness of zero.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
What physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality underlying the bottom of the <unk>
As he explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that he puts fire into equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not being out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that he shouldn't eat anything to have consciousness, then I must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think of thinking about this, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral terms, is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are having a lot of serious ethical problems about the ethic of development of the development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an inner movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is the second thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're going to go to solve it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village on Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a evident.
She actually hasn't got <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an profile under the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as an achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What would you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about things that are embedded in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't have it, and it's not my boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people, we're there to be there.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to <unk> Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lied to me in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something -- to <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing to live with a disability, to make you beautiful.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we have been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because I went to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, they will teach the disabilities in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, it's very bad than my life, could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times the number of times that have been talking about strange to say that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my job had a public profile.
It was like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will engage people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
Are you there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their worries in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
Some things were going on.
But the things we think about are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was excited about the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies to get the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because we have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And I honestly don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> inspiration -- and you think, "Oh God, you are not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> this is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things they fall over.  <unk> the neat trick of how to charge the battery battery cell in your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that we have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stretch of stairs has never done a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen will not make the <unk> <unk>
They don't have a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a girl, 15 years old, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> you don't think of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we're going to be able to get out of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 grade in Melbourne is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a user <unk>
The disability does not make us <unk> but question what you think you know to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and football football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think actually <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> their hands in the air, but reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know that, because the reality needs to be able to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how do we get to <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would agree with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds <unk> us trying to do it with all of your self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I would have a few videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the shell, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not the images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface, but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the field of football, from <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> from <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite <unk> and they've been asked at YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get out of <unk> how we put it to the next <unk>
We took it on this level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you already know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian roller <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan of a fan of Adrian when a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball into the bottom of the network? or <unk> by doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers were <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a brief approach to technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore took a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers out because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're going on, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
You either memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties, you have a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view of the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> them something that is already working on.
And all of that information is <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have <unk>
This is <unk> to the good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being just for <unk>
It would also be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
I went on to a open receptor -- suddenly, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will <unk> you.
They went to the area of protection.
Another <unk> will you tell you that there's an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people looking at it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite designer.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, to be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how actions they are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes over.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently became <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years came to me by <unk> the southern end of the county of <unk> County that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer decided to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is no practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that all of you releases all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bones, some of which makes vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that not, they would normally get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this suicide method is going to realize the death of the death of the people who are <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel on the bridge.
This is where most people get before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had this day to bring that day back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who were killed, but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, medical officials today and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the <unk> 22 year when they got a call from a possible subject of a suicide subject sitting on the middle of the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking with an official of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> I created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could get more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came up with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
She stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of <unk> guy from New Jersey had just got my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how it was.
<unk> parents had been able to order.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you find?
What do you say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to hear it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have been thinking about to end their life, you've had these <unk>
They get to the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost of the interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking to your friends telling your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> <unk> with his father the 19 of the <unk>
He never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and told me that the car car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before not having a real mental illness.
It should be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way her son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I replied to a radio call by a <unk> subject on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north tower.
I was walking on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw, he crossed immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next time, I heard about Kevin and Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to find that day back on that lane will give life another chance.
When Kevin turned out to it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did, and he gave the hope and life was <unk>
And you know what he said.
He said, "I <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of <unk> and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> <unk> <unk> and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as it says.
We give God for you.
I became a debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes to <unk> <unk> When I visited San Francisco Hospital that night, you will be <unk> as the patient.
I knew I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, giving me theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want your own chest pain.
Usually this is just about three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents where I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
During that time, I took my hand on three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one one one one one one one one one percent -- the majority of those people have said that the second one people have said that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be working on to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you don't are, but you know what you are, and a question asks you how you would focus on that?
I must be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my myself.
It was complicated for reasons that I'm going to talk to me later, when I look at this picture, I think, you managed to do it -- <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We will all embrace our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the color of the skin or for the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, I even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, and I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom was like, "Why do you always wear that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be a bad thing, but how the world is about to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have Mom, Dad and family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture, which celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess of <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever done in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she was <unk> she was going to be hanging out of the <unk> and <unk> and that night, and that night, I won in <unk> and I won on <unk> and he was a third finalist in more than 40 distances.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was within the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was the Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
And I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you <unk> America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most highly sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before changing the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20, and we make a global <unk> by the <unk> Day of <unk>
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who were <unk> and stood up with injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth, and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You will do it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. And first of all, thank you to thank all of my <unk>
I would support my network of support, my parents especially, to my family, who is actually very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called, and they told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I took my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked out. It's not just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned to give you a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that <unk> didn't block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> Thank you.
In many different societies, tribal societies, to the parents are generally known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known to her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending her rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when you were born a girl, their birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome for your father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of <unk> a young girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, they were <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just mother suffering, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers from as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits of her brothers.
Up until the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when he comes into adolescence, when he was 13 years old, he gets a fan of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, you might even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's one more standard of the <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embrace the decisions of their father and her mother and people's decisions even if he doesn't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his kids.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and he grabbed my pen, and I was able to put a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years old.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies in tribal societies, is a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
One <unk> to school means he's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where their potential can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That's why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And I was able to sit down with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson.
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the economic and economic activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the 10 years, <unk> got up and picked up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the invention of the BBC, he was offered her himself as well for the New York Times, and I spoke in every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine of October 2012, was taken to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and to me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would give him to the ear to my wife -- "I've got to <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both of them were on the right path and God <unk>
So these few words would spend a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and she had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give you right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult, and I'm happy to share with you that despite the rights of children and women and women, is like any <unk>
<unk> when he didn't work.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about a special <unk> who has done so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I did what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a brain patient.
You're still as smart or not?
It won't be like this, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to help them to follow alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the dose to try to get the <unk> dose, because there's really no one clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to test with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the dose -- dramatically my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking about who I was like, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case <unk> for a few months, and I tried a typical chemical dose for a man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I was thought that it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several types like this, or perhaps some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an end.
But my big surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem that had to the front, and just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, since then I spent better with men.
What I was trying to do is to <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after disease and <unk> my new thinking -- my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference to the point of the key imaging that I can do to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are many discussions about how the brain works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So, after many years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> you really find a lot sophisticated and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use his imagination just to run the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the only thing is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're quite close to this with two recent experiments done by two groups leading by two groups to the neuroscience.
They both used cognitive technology, image by functional MRI, to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The spine of the middle shows the brain scan of that same individual as you get in, looking at that same image.
The column on the right created <unk> the content of the central column of the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated by many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves in visual fields.
Let's go this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were monitoring their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to the video sequences of video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain data of the scanning image of the scanning <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're very close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now remember, when you look at a picture and when you imagine that same image, it creates the same thing as <unk>
This led to the brain scan systems available today, and their resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't give me that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even I was <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the way to be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, it doesn't increases by thousands of them.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets we do better again."
We can create a much more complex structures with slightly different ones, like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of brilliant and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the farmers.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field -- it will create magnetic patterns structured patterns that are linked to the radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing, and we can increase <unk> we can increase in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide in layers of our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands of thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid but the ones and the <unk> that I mentioned -- and maybe even the direct neural activity is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few choices to open this door.
Anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it takes a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet might be telling some person for the first time that they love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have to do in life.
So I am doing a hard conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side -- <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope by the slope of my pants <unk> and I would have <unk> my head -- I was doing a little bit of a kid -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And there would be a uncomfortable silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and it was <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where a child between three and 10 years was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You are a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get to get into the female issues at the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a segment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
Then I took a little bit of the eyes and I went down and I went down and my backs was four years with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist, <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
And so I took a lot of it again, again, I started <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I saw a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of a little girl <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- <unk> "Oh, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some lengths in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why we come out of my closet was more difficult to come out of their life, but this is the <unk> the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared banking who has declared <unk> it's harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I'm telling is more difficult to tell your son of five years that you will go to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what it's hard to do with about what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our capabilities, and we have to only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made -- a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and shoes of <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years that would fit in the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> <unk> and to move only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friend of strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around on purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of them invited them to know that I was gay, and by making my wife's lady <unk> in my black dress, and my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay account had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite show Will Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in order to show desperately their support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using shirts, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we might have.
It's like the hard conversations continue to remain my strong point.
Ask anybody with whom I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be you.
That girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must be able to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can be wounded wounded and <unk> for what they've done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find you in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how you have seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
So let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or intelligence from Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly healthy lives -- so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the intelligence of the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that explained how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, which <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of the universal states, the diversity of possible future <unk>
Finally, in a robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to make complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, from a number of years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the equivalent of the closest to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options, with a force of possible <unk> with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yes, even an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping the ground.
And so, having to notice this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It will be the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that those universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life to have to trend more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence <unk> a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long run, but it actually arises from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy and long-term entropy production in any system where you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could be a number of animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even making money <unk> actions, all of them without the way to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This skill of equilibrium will have applications for <unk> robotics and human care.
This capacity for tools will have applications in manufacturing tools and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other different fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here's successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps the very successful network.
This same <unk> ability also has to have applications in health care and energy care and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend its scope of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of treating actions, successfully increase in the asset under their exponential management.
This ability of risk management will have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the work <unk> there was always the concept that if you were going to get smart machines that would have a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion,
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had all the concept of rebellion in the other way.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come from control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial papers or to help them understand human intelligence, it is this: intelligence must be view as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding the restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the Duolingo of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we have expanded very much our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
<unk> Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them in front of them, and they block a little bit of that light that we are.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their star star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small, <unk> like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of political worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the <unk>
<unk> and ice that has been with us since millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a matter scientist in the weather, and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone is very interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more the planets look like planets like the Earth, most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and in part, that's why we study both on Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> <unk> <unk> and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images, they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the world's areas of our planet that still remain in <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places on Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our rainforests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag up with a big and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief and the belief that Mars would wait for the save of this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
So I like <unk> exploration -- I'm in profound disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to <unk> humanity is how to imagine the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of Titanic will tell us that the party would actually have place later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and knowledge preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They are only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile and hostile areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist. Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi said, considering the universe that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life that we should have found the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are going to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only Africa's colonization, will save us from ourselves, but the planetary knowledge and <unk> exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to recreate the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would have my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the kitchen table, where there were <unk>
So he tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were okay.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least she had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff <unk> to visit night because I had an early flight in Europe to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my bag.
They were expensive, but you certainly don't have more expensive than a <unk> to a half night, so I thought, well that despite the circumstances, still stopped.
I'm a staff, and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> the adrenaline of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in their place, which was going to be bad things happening.
Or at least if bad things happen, you will be able to be able to be a total of total catastrophe <unk>
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> from the Nobel <unk> and a little embarrassed to talk about the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing with me who had been practicing something called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what's going wrong, right?
In the <unk> as he explains <unk> you look forward and try and figure out all the things that might be wrong, then trying to figure out what can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about with you is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, we would get a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science who supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good things are, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the tribes live, where the tribes are living and friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move very much.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, reading reading and <unk>
So at home, I would get a place for the keys, a hook to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular knew.
For your reading glasses a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone, a picture of your credit card license license off to drive, passport, <unk> yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of us of medical decisions and actually for decision-making and social decisions and any kind of choice that you have to take from which would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- it's probably likely to be known to people that <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do so, a statistic that you should ask for most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must be thinking about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number needs to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault -- it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they can help one person.
300.
This is based on the tech research researchers, <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
And I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid one heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, let's get the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things that include <unk> or muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, "The Five five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have a side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that helps you the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is what's required, is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the older men in the 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number needs to try is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects just -- one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can make you have to make the conversation going forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, you want a better life out of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change from opinion in the <unk> but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you shut a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, don't react to be the way to be lunch and so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational, rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination next to the door, with a key way to remember the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch the <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came up during the decade in 1800, and over the time it was mixed with local signs, and it became the language that we know now as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign world, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example for example.
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you don't have any <unk> <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm so <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to be able to do it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a <unk> or the experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all that they had taught me about sound, and I decided to leave it and do it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> the social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could go to me and my art work, or I could get it <unk>
I chose to <unk> me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, to the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as to become my voice.
In that way, I am able to be relevant to today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me become <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, for asking <unk> his voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel like I could do it in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capturing and expressing a whole piece of paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of signals as well as <unk>
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in a lot of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while you play the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so, while the piano is <unk> the English is a linear language, as if you get <unk> just a match at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the time to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens to music in terms of tone and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters you can express different ideas.
So for example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and it takes it.
This is <unk>
If you <unk> it and <unk> the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present it gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and a dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everyone with their hands.
Now we're going to do so much in my head as your chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool for helping to communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please get it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they bring very different meanings out.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich centimeter and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to try to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a ignorance of ignorance I must say, because the adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not really good for cleaning the others.
The time, I'm now adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with a lot of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to get them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats <unk>
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that children are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electric tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's it.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children were getting a lot with the robots.
Then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we made the light bulb and the web cameras on accessories. And we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board can process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm looking at my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image: right?
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil spill, just using your hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help form a remote other children.
I was forced to find a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, perhaps to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm a Japanese and Japanese half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he had a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died at a moment.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear center close to water.
And today, according to the reports of a 300 metric tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution and <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the ground, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we ran to the center of <unk> here you see the use of masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take serious work, but they were doing it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all your life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition -- the nearest to the nuclear center until date.
We are approaching a mile of the nuclear plant, and with the aid aid of the area we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
So here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to the environmental impact of social impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical biology, basically can be built almost from all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with aid, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard wheels into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens, scientists, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned with the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel, the other one of a silk thread of <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other believed it is.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that will be free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find any <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You're acting primarily like filter the other primarily as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts of it, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- <unk> the double personality of every designer and architect in working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between the assembly and the growth, and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right analysis and analytics is shown in both screens after me.
My work, at the very simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and approaching growth.
You will probably ask why now?
Why couldn't it be this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where you have four disciplines that give designers access to the tools that we never had access to the tools we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a span of 24 meters in diameter with a force that someday not very far by print <unk> buildings, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> only to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> <unk> van <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> without seams between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
This is also the resolution of a brain scanner, <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow them to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair in the same time, comfortable and also absorbs sound.
The professor Carter -- my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
They have the surface of 44 different properties, that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's <unk> nature.
There are no parts of nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible Bible, and one of them came to me and he came to find a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God applied to the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did growing trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects were made from a single part?
I went to a better state of <unk>
So we look at the material -- the kind of material that we have the kind of material on the <unk> tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of <unk> each year for organisms like shrimp, or crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune in to <unk> their properties, we could generate structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk> of <unk>
We have chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures that are made from one three three years long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are <unk> it stops it to find a natural way to the air with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to be used to contain <unk> <unk> that first arose on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make the transition without problems of <unk> <unk> and if it extends even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of <unk> of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed in the ground, they'll grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological beings inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the <unk> water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One makes the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
So to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help you build these bacteria and to make their function on the way.
So we started to grow these channels in the human body -- we would have the properties of the material according to the so-called <unk> functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they were more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to the other, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our small intestine in it.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in bright <unk> in your clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are hot creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> the soft tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology of it.
So you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer, it prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't make it like this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated sophisticated architecture, a home in which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of a combination of materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm of the silk worm of the silk.
However, when I put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we had a cocoon plane and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are <unk> to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can shape the raw silk way to a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we managed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making Social Deposition and we put ourselves into our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to be more dark and more dark and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat down, distributes silk worms about the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to hang on with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
At <unk> biological silk -- <unk> silk -- they give this whole pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms, <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired to a nature inspired by a nature inspired by the first time, that requires us to make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time to you?
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
They have caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had a <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and spent websites, and I also played the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist in anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this sense of this is no longer a challenge, it goes to <unk>
And I have to give it out.
But then I would get rid of something else, something totally different, and I would leave you on it, and I let myself <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me as much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of commitment, or to be rude to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
They encourage themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you are, you learned about the culture.
So what do you first want to be a question -- "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause cute answers to children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is about us over and over again, as we grow in various shapes, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to pick up the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before it takes us to sleep.
Why?
Now, if this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, how nice, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative conductor.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
This is this idea of fate or the true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to have something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And so there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so to say.
It could help if you divide in three parts: a <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance period, the ideal was who I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or you want to do it in your own.
I think it seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to look at <unk> as limitation or woe you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data visualization and mathematics and design, when he found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
So the new ideas come from.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the very rapid learning.
When we were <unk> we are <unk> for something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> because they have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we have, so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their bone, and this ability help to write the compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to do what you would do to you, even if you end up the end of it.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have been <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other paper designer designer, sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, and sometimes master, and, sometimes, apparently, a <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Magazine Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to deal with to meet the market needs, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex issues, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The bank can dive deep into a depth of ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are going to engage with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are going to tell them to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart line, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world are <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took him to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
But the most amazing thing.
If I had been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk>
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I am a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's as a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million who, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to the age 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's might be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability of you to pass your years to spend with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or to be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a <unk> increase in the year by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's -- despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar year of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, even, scientists, <unk> with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy healthy brain in comparison with a patient patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused the brain to significantly reduce life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
So you put a cable to do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that's done.
Until recently, most of you have been reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, chemical chemicals, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new type of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have a protein molecules that are attached to each other inside them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that they are <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result -- but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to assume that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we think about it, we can <unk> it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have topped more research and <unk> pressure industry, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience to test it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strange <unk> to get 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow in a quality or ability, what would be?
Number <unk> When was it the last time you get to someone another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner -- what do you like to do, or her, I know very close to this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you have ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really detail really struck me the attention, the gossip that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column of a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask, keep you still yet.
And the reason I think about this is because I have done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before he was publishing the article was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But you had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and since Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I already had called the "Today <unk> and Good <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence in writing with it all of the experiences that are <unk> but another thing is that the loving life of a has been international news --  and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or I was writing it, what they did every day for weeks, always, they were doing the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, gave a talk, and a woman yelled up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where your <unk> is.
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to sit comfortable wondering about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have a life <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said that not every request that we both did a public onset together.
I have interviews of TV, and <unk> orders for photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the icons of <unk> the process of <unk> a range of which I didn't feel like it was at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know whether they really wanted to know whether it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, above all, that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if they were to put together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was able to foster interpersonal focus on college students.
Sounds romantic isn't it?
But the study did it work.
The participants felt closer to do that, several later studies, they also used government protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people in the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little <unk> liberal arts liberal arts and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed to be <unk> by it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom I read it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
They knew they were able to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I had had that relationship since he had 20, what I was supposed to find all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I turned to the science.
And so I did everything I could find about romantic love science and hoped that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just research for the book that I would write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I used to be then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way.
I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I looked at.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than I reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for from love is an inch, not only to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be that this kind of guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some way to mitigate something about <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because fall in love to make it feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question -- we want to ask questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love in love to love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably gives you a relationship? Or even more, how you live with your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a better conversation about what to love somebody.
So if you want the brief version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, one known and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we get <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, there was no idea what was supposed to be.
He didn't know how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much of you will have to keep making that choice without knowing before he was always choosing or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say, 36 questions, having chosen to love someone as generous, and kind and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think about.
And what they did, and what perhaps spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also wants to love, and it's scary, but that's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> and I was raised in a mountain and a certain way I got as a <unk> forest.
I was a time in New York City a time ago.  Something that really touched me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and <unk> a dollar bill of a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the weird <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's partly because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took away all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> at Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: the opposite happened, somehow it seemed to increase the size of size, as if it was that it was <unk> with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, and weird bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens from specimens from <unk>
First of all, you have to be able to make an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of resin of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing of a window, then in another window, and then another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my <unk> work with something very big, that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds.
It's 20 feet long.
It has double <unk> so they are 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the <unk> of <unk> to this <unk> mesh mesh where they were <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are heading to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied up to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while of the other hand, they get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand in which they <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail does fire to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go and you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> made of suicide cards.
They have <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
It brings me to the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material or magazine or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they are coming together.
And you can walk between them. It's bringing me up.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest is <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to come up with the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it has a kind of thing <unk>
This is a quick quick of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There is a few pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue of this <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you choose who is and the box in which it's living on.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries of the borders, the religion, it doesn't work.
We're all made out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we didn't start to swap those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has the effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'm going to take a pill. It's the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is going to be in the body.
The <unk> though, is that when any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take <unk> drugs are going to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects -- in its most negative people, because in the time that it takes to get to the current light, and you get worse than the time it takes to their fate, which is more importantly, in the HIV <unk>
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, our lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get into the blood stream of the patients who are <unk> into regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life that is <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for careful wounds and surgery for diabetes, you can be used for anything to do, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser <unk> to open or drill extremely small, open holes open and shut down almost immediately cells living with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam of the membrane living cell with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's going to the place of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you're successful, this technology can lead to the full eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher <unk> in our case, a <unk> treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups that are armed by armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
So what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these factors of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to nonviolent <unk>
I do work in the field, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of <unk> and 2011, <unk> had been signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons that we <unk> how do they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle was <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> also has established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking
We would have a complex machinery of <unk> stations, radio stations, channels of TV, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here have the magazine <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising level, but through business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put in a professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn out by war, or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to see the efforts of these groups to bring security together.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher interest for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, when we look at the groups of <unk> we just think of the violent <unk>
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, we are less able to <unk> it as something opposite to a state.
How would they call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of your <unk> they collect the trash -- run the system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of <unk> nations and <unk> and the more weak people are states, like in the Middle East, more <unk> and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more on the military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will better understand what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to the violence of violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some <unk> but not give us peace and stability.
So to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid they accept openly the label <unk> would be unfair to <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist thing.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and to the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are being treated around the world and the anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist person.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a word and taboo and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who is asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine to be another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept I am, in fact, feminist, a feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have right to use it easy and accessible to contraceptives and services and <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to see our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and social condition and skills and much more.
We need to be aware of these differences and how we behave in the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear music rap -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades women and <unk> deep -- the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin Yin and yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical sounds.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all that I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies in the fairy fairy tales, which makes it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that they make women economically vulnerable when they are <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has bypassed or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, the gay <unk> and <unk> and <unk> women and <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist thing.
It also happens as this: as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
So we have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that they were doing perfection.
When we asked ourselves the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag is, for fear of not being able to fulfill the <unk> expectations.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star star to embrace openly feminism and making women and young men who become feminist -- is something to be proud of it.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless arguments if we were to find it -- it was not just feminist or not true.
They would take their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection for the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We're going to go much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or more good, feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to the day, going to the action and be a little <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than they would be happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they change the change to affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve to do, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
They are going to tell you about the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men who are white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in their magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until you don't have enough of women, both to participate in the way to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be even even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision decision.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without adopt these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions go to the top, to people in the power of police directors, and producers of film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also be able to be able to be a sense of courage and bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> to be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I was born, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I would lie in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked at me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the handy reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need to be a little bit courageous, as a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things that this outbreak can be lousy for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a half century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the paper that unleashed the controversial thing about autism and vaccines would be determined and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical School.
It doesn't believe most scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her -- they believed to develop their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were stable about three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started <unk>
<unk> funds like <unk> <unk> are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic, as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people to the Center for Disease Control and Atlanta is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "A better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of her son of two years, the visual contact guy.
If the criteria criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow and <unk> progress that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how autism was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked at 11 young patients who looked at the people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands before their faces, but they were panic for <unk> as when they don't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By 1950, as a major authority of the world in the subject, stated that he had seen less than about 150 true cases of their syndrome as it was <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
One time she had turned out that he had become nine percent of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child culture caused by cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, <unk> have been very carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like the children were just getting rid of what they had heard their parents better to win their approval.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a child with no services without special education, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
They took a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse together.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit into beautiful <unk> and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody hadn't realized about these children before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the year next to the article of <unk> and that then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and the children followed their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabled <unk> of life that required forms of support and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her small teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, watching aspects of this continuous <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 80 and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by one broader and <unk>
These changes didn't stay in <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked on the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an individual adult for the first time.
Before he came out -- <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, <unk> and parents from everybody knew what autism.
At the same time, the first simple clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I had no connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a perfect storm effect -- a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it was, so I get people with autism and their families finally supported the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame for the increase in the <unk> and a powerful, powerful history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart of preventing one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are puzzles for solving new advances -- medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that it creates the most mundane aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As opposed to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
